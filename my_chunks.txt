chunk 59 content...
kharagpur are underpinned by a clearly defined grading system and a comprehensive set of academic regulations. these policies ensure fair evaluation and provide structured pathways for student development and remediation. 5.1. grading system: letter grades and grade points lit kharagpur employs a precise 7-scale grading system to assess student performance, where each letter grade is assigned specific grade points per credit.* this system is designed to provide a transparent and standardized metric for academic achievement across all courses and departments. the letter grades and their corresponding grade points are as follows: excellent (ex): 10 grade points very good (a): 9 grade points good (b): 8 grade points fair (c): 7 grade points average (d): 6 grade points pass (p): 5 grade points e fail (f): o grade points additionally, a distinct grading symbol, x, is used to denote instances where a student has been deregistered or debarred from a particular subject. this specific

chunk 60 content...
where a student has been deregistered or debarred from a particular subject. this specific designation highlights the institute's strict adherence to its attendance and conduct policies. the clear definition of each grade and its numerical equivalent facilitates consistent evaluation across the institution and enables external stakeholders, such as potential employers or other academic institutions, to easily interpret academic records. table 5: iit kharagpur grading system letter grade grade points per credit excellent (ex) no \very good (a) 9 good (b) 8 fair (c) 7 average (d) 6 pass (p) ie) fail (f) (@) deregistered/debarred (x) in/a (indicates non-completion) 5.2. sgpa and cgpa calculation methodology the academic performance of students at iit kharagpur is comprehensively tracked through two key metrics: semester grade point average (sgpa) and cumulative grade point average (cgpa). the sgpa is computed at the end of each semester. it is calculated by summing the product of the

chunk 61 content...
the sgpa is computed at the end of each semester. it is calculated by summing the product of the credits (c_i) and the grade points (g_i) for all subjects a student has registered for and successfully cleared in that specific semester. this sum is then divided by the total number of credits for those subjects. the resulting sgpa is rounded off to the second decimal place, providing a precise indicator of a student's performance within a given academic term. for students admitted from the 2014-2015 batch onwards, the sgpa calculation explicitly includes all registered subjects, regardless of whether they were cleared initially.* the cgpa is a cumulative measure of academic performance, computed at the end of every semester starting from the second semester. it follows a similar calculation methodology: the sum of the product of credits and grade points for all subjects registered and cleared from the first semester up to and including the current semester is divided by the total

chunk 62 content...
cleared from the first semester up to and including the current semester is divided by the total cumulative credits. the cgpa is also rounded to two decimal places, reflecting the student's overall academic standing throughout their program.° a supportive policy is in place for handling 'f' grades. when a student initially receives an 'f' grade in any subject, a ‘zero point' is temporarily used for the calculation of their sgpa and cgpa. however, if the student subsequently clears the 'f' grade by achieving a better grade in a later semester, the sgpa and cgpa of all affected semesters (starting from the earliest semester where the 'f' grade was updated) are recomputed and officially recorded to reflect the improved academic standing.’ this mechanism provides a pathway for students to recover from academic setbacks and improve their overall performance. for instances where external parties, such as potential employers, require a conversion of cgpa into percentage marks, a standardized

chunk 63 content...
such as potential employers, require a conversion of cgpa into percentage marks, a standardized notional conversion formula is applied: percentage marks = cgpa * 10.° this ensures a consistent and easily interpretable conversion for external assessment. the dual system of sgpa and cgpa, coupled with the 'f' grade remediation policy, offers a comprehensive and dynamic record of student academic progress. this framework enables timely academic interventions for students facing difficulties and presents a fair and accurate representation of their cumulative achievement to external entities. 5.3. year repeat and backlog policies lit kharagpur maintains structured policies for students who need to repeat a year or manage backlog courses, designed to support academic progression while upholding rigorous standards. for students repeating a year of study, the primary requirement is to first register for any backlog subjects from the corresponding semester they are repeating. these students

chunk 64 content...
for any backlog subjects from the corresponding semester they are repeating. these students are generally permitted to undertake up to 20 credits of coursework per semester. in specific cases, with the recommendation of their department and approval from the academic dean, this limit may be extended to a maximum of 23 credits. furthermore, students repeating a year have the option to re-register in subjects where they previously obtained a 'p' (pass) grade, with the aim of improving their performance, provided they adhere to the established credit limits.°° backlog courses are defined broadly to include not only subjects in which a student has failed or been de-registered, but also any curricular components that were not registered in previous semesters and have thus accrued.*° the regulations for managing backlogs vary based on the student's academic standing and year of study: e students with one backlog are permitted to register for the prescribed credits of their current semester

chunk 65 content...
with one backlog are permitted to register for the prescribed credits of their current semester in addition to the backlog subject.*° e for non-final year students with two backlogs, their total credit registration is capped at 28 credits.*® e final year students with two backlogs are allowed to register for their prescribed credits and a maximum of two backlog subjects, provided their cumulative grade point average (cgpa) is 6 or higher.°° it is important to note that certain non-classroom credit components, such as industrial training, field trips, comprehensive viva voce, and extra academic activities (eaa), are explicitly excluded when calculating these credit limits for backlog or year-repeating students. these subjects are also not counted towards the number of backlogs for registration purposes.°° this exclusion helps to focus the credit limits on the core academic coursework. these detailed policies for year repeats and backlogs demonstrate a structured approach to managing

chunk 66 content...
these detailed policies for year repeats and backlogs demonstrate a structured approach to managing academic deficiencies. the specific credit limits and registration rules are designed to balance academic rigor with practical opportunities for remediation. this framework aims to provide a necessary support system for students facing academic challenges, enabling them to recover and progress towards graduation while ensuring that the institute's academic standards are consistently maintained. 5.4. credit limits per semester lit kharagpur implements a system of credit limits per semester that is dynamically adjusted based on a student's academic standing, ensuring a balanced workload and facilitating appropriate academic interventions. for normal students who have successfully completed all curricular requirements up to the preceding semester, the expectation is to register for all prescribed curricular requirements of the current semester. high-achieving students, specifically those

chunk 67 content...
curricular requirements of the current semester. high-achieving students, specifically those with a cumulative grade point average (cgpa) of 7.5 or higher, are granted the flexibility to opt for additional subjects beyond their regular curriculum. furthermore, students in their 5th semester with a cgpa of 7.5 or above are eligible to register for a minor specialization, and those beyond the second semester with a cgpa of 7 or higher can pursue a micro-specialization.®° this policy encourages and rewards academic excellence by allowing students to deepen their knowledge or explore interdisciplinary areas. for students with backlogs, the credit limits are adjusted to ensure a manageable workload while addressing academic deficiencies. students with a single backlog are permitted to register for the prescribed credits of their current semester in addition to the backlog subject. non-final year students carrying two backlogs face a restriction, with their total registered credits capped

chunk 68 content...
year students carrying two backlogs face a restriction, with their total registered credits capped at 28. in contrast, final year students who have two backlogs but maintain a cgpa of 6 or above are allowed to take their prescribed credits along with a maximum of two backlog subjects.° academically weak students, defined as those with a notional cgpa below 6.0 (regardless of the number of backlogs), are subject to stricter credit limitations. these students are typically allowed to take a maximum of 20 credits of coursework per semester. in exceptional circumstances, with the recommendation of their faculty adviser and head of the department, and approval from the academic dean, this limit may be extended to 23 credits. for this category of students, it is mandatory to register for backlog or unregistered subjects first, if they are offered. additionally, these students are restricted to registering for only one project at a time, and this credit limit is inclusive of any subjects

chunk 69 content...
to registering for only one project at a time, and this credit limit is inclusive of any subjects they re-register for improvement. such students are flagged within the erp system, and their academic registration must be completed through their faculty advisor, ensuring close monitoring and guidance.*° this differentiated approach to credit limits based on academic performance reflects a policy designed to optimize student learning and progression. the lower credit limits for academically weak students are intended to prevent overload and allow for focused remediation, while the flexibility for high-achieving students encourages advanced learning. this framework underscores the importance of maintaining a minimum cgpa for full academic flexibility and provides a structured environment for all students to succeed. 5.5. supplementary and re-examination policies iit knharagpur's examination policies are designed to provide opportunities for students to address academic deficiencies while

policies are designed to provide opportunities for students to address academic deficiencies while emphasizing a comprehensive approach to learning rather than mere re-testing. supplementary examinations are available to students who fail in one or more subjects during a regular semester. to be eligible, students must typically apply through the erp system and pay a prescribed fee. crucially, eligibility usually requires that the student must have attended classes for the subject and not have been debarred from the original examination."* this ensures that supplementary exams are a chance for those who genuinely struggled despite engagement, rather than a bypass for attendance requirements. for students aiming to improve their grades, the institute does not permit a simple re-take of only the end-semester examination. instead, students can choose to re-register for a subject from scratch, a process formally termed an “improvement subject." this option is available if the student

chunk 71 content...
a process formally termed an “improvement subject." this option is available if the student previously received a ‘p' (pass) grade in the subject and their overall cumulative grade point average (cgpa) is below 6.0. re-registering for an improvement subject necessitates attending all classes and mid-semester examinations for that subject again. if a student achieves a better grade upon re-registration, the new grade replaces the old one in their academic record, and the semester grade point average (sgpa) for the relevant semester is automatically updated. however, if the student fails the improvement attempt, their original 'p' grade is retained, ensuring that the attempt to improve does not negatively impact their existing passing grade.” this policy promotes a holistic re-engagement with the course material, encouraging genuine understanding and sustained effort throughout the semester, rather than merely cramming for a single examination. it also reinforces the institute's minimum

chunk 72 content...
rather than merely cramming for a single examination. it also reinforces the institute's minimum academic standard of a 6.0 cgpa for the award of a b.tech. (hons.) degree. a distinct policy applies to additional subjects. if a student fails an “additional subject," there is no provision for a supplementary examination for that specific course. the student must either repeat the same additional subject in a subsequent semester when it is offered or opt to take an alternate additional subject. this differentiation suggests that additional subjects, taken for enrichment beyond core requirements, carry different academic consequences compared to mandatory curriculum components. these policies collectively emphasize a focus on comprehensive re-learning and engagement with course material for academic improvement. the distinction between supplementary examinations for outright failures and re-registration for improvement for 'p' grades indicates a nuanced approach to academic intervention.

for improvement for 'p' grades indicates a nuanced approach to academic intervention. the differing rules for additional subjects further highlight the varied academic weight and consequences associated with different types of courses. 5.6. medical leave policy and its impact iit kharagpur has a structured medical leave policy designed to support student well-being while ensuring academic continuity. the process begins when a student reports an illness to the b.c. roy technology hospital (bcrth), the institute's medical facility. based on the assessment and advice of the senior medical officer (smo) at bcrth, the student may be kept for observation (overnight or a few days of rest in the hostel), admitted to bcrth, or referred to a tertiary hospital or for home treatment.” for cases involving referrals to external hospitals or illnesses occurring while the student is away from the institute (e.g., at home), a specific documentation protocol must be followed. initially, the student is

chunk 74 content...
(e.g., at home), a specific documentation protocol must be followed. initially, the student is required to upload a scanned copy of annexure | (initial report), duly signed, which is then recorded in the erp system. subsequently, scanned copies of annexure il (interim medical updates from the attending specialist) must be uploaded at regular intervals. upon recovery and discharge from the hospital or completion of home treatment, a scanned copy of annexure iii, signed by a medical specialist, must be uploaded. this final document must include details of the treatment schedule, relevant test reports, and prescribed medicines. physical hard copies of all these annexures, along with supporting documents like test reports and discharge certificates, must also be submitted to bcrth.°” bcrth then assesses the student's fitness to rejoin classes and can extend medical leave if the illness has not fully resolved, repeating the documentation cycle as necessary.°” the policy outlines clear

has not fully resolved, repeating the documentation cycle as necessary.°” the policy outlines clear implications for prolonged medical leave, particularly concerning financial assistance and academic standing. the erp system meticulously tracks the total medical leave days per semester or academic year. for postgraduate (pg), master of science (ms), and ph.d. students, if their medical leave collectively exceeds 30 days within an academic year (july to june), their scholarship may be suspended.’ for undergraduate (ug) students, if their total medical leave surpasses 30 days per semester (july to december and january to june), a formal medical withdrawal order may be issued by the institute.°? the erp system provides a dedicated link (academic -> student -> medical link) for managing medical leave information.°? this detailed medical leave policy demonstrates the institute's commitment to balancing student welfare with the imperative of academic integrity. while providing necessary

chunk 76 content...
to balancing student welfare with the imperative of academic integrity. while providing necessary support and a clear process for managing health-related absences, the policy also establishes clear boundaries for academic continuity. the explicit consequences for extended leave, such as scholarship suspension or medical withdrawal, underscore that prolonged absence can have significant academic and financial repercussions. this encourages students to prioritize their recovery and re-engage with their studies in a timely manner. it is worth noting that while the policy details leave procedures, it does not explicitly outline specific provisions for make-up examinations directly impacted by medical leave, suggesting such scenarios may be handled through broader supplementary examination policies or on a case-by-case basis. 6. important academic portals lit kharagpur leverages a sophisticated digital infrastructure to support its extensive academic and administrative functions. the

by a strong emphasis on adherence to rules, respect for authority, and clear consequences for indiscipline.° this dual focus indicates that the institution aims to cultivate well-rounded individuals, but within a clearly defined and disciplined framework. the institute's approach suggests a "freedom with responsibility" philosophy that guides campus life, where personal growth is encouraged within the bounds of institutional regulations and a strong sense of community responsibility. the governance structure for student life is multi-layered, allowing for both localized problem-solving and institutional consistency. the senate is the supreme academic body °, the dean (students' affairs) oversees conduct and welfare °, and hostel administration is managed by individual wardens with central coordination from the hall management centre (hmc).* disciplinary actions can be initiated at the departmental level by the head of department, at the hall level by the warden, or more broadly by the

level by the head of department, at the hall level by the warden, or more broadly by the dean (students' affairs), with escalation for major cases to the standing institute disciplinary committee.* this tiered governance model allows for efficient handling of diverse student issues. minor issues can be addressed promptly by the immediate authority, such as a warden for hostel matters, preventing unnecessary escalation. conversely, serious or systemic violations are escalated to higher committees, ensuring thorough investigation, consistent application of rules, and appropriate institutional-level consequences. this structure helps maintain order and fairness across the large student body. il. academic honesty and plagiarism policy academic integrity is a fundamental expectation for all students at iit kharagpur.’ the core principle dictates that students should ideally complete assignments and examinations by consulting only the material provided to them.’ if any external resources

the hmc maintains a substantial operational capacity, employing 296 regular staff members to manage the residential facilities.* furthermore, students pursuing ms and phd degrees through specific projects are accommodated in the vsrc (sponsored research and industrial consultancy cell), also managed by the institute.’ in terms of services, a hybrid model is employed for catering: some halls utilize regular hall staff for meal preparation and service, while others outsource these functions to private agencies. cleaning services, however, are uniformly outsourced across all halls of residence, ensuring a consistent standard of hygiene.” the residential nature of iit kharagpur campus life the iit kharagpur campus is exceptionally expansive, covering approximately 2100 acres, or 8.5 square kilometers, and is home to a significant population of around 22,000 individuals, including over 12,000 students who reside across its 21 halls of residence.’ this extensive residential setup is

12,000 students who reside across its 21 halls of residence.’ this extensive residential setup is intentionally designed to cultivate a holistic student experience, actively encouraging participation in a wide spectrum of extra-curricular and co-curricular activities. this engagement is primarily facilitated through the technology students’ gymkhana and various hall-managed events, which are central to the campus social fabric.’ the institute adopts a philosophy of treating its students as "young adults," granting them considerable autonomy. this is particularly evident in the absence of strict in-time or out-time rules for hostels, allowing students a degree of freedom in managing their schedules.’ this freedom is, however, balanced with an expectation of responsible conduct, reflecting the institute's commitment to nurturing mature and accountable individuals." nuances of campus experience the structure of residential life at iit kharagpur, while centrally managed, presents a varied

the structure of residential life at iit kharagpur, while centrally managed, presents a varied experience for students across its numerous halls. the hall management centre (hmc) is a large, centralized entity responsible for broad policies concerning mess, maintenance, and allocation for over 10,000 students across 20+ halls.’ however, observations from student experiences indicate that the quality of room maintenance and mess food can vary significantly between halls.® discussions among students suggest that despite official policies and oversight committees, the actual daily experience is often shaped by the effectiveness of hall-level leadership, such as wardens and general secretaries, and the degree of active student participation within each hall.’ some halls are perceived as having a more vibrant culture or better-managed facilities due to a more engaged student body. this suggests that while the hmc establishes the foundational framework, the practical implementation and

chunk 225 content...
that while the hmc establishes the foundational framework, the practical implementation and student satisfaction are heavily influenced by the specific dynamics and self-governance within each hall. therefore, understanding the student experience requires acknowledging both the official policies and the qualitative differences between halls. furthermore, the emphasis on iit kharagpur as a residential institution fosters a distinct "home away from home" identity, cultivating a largely self-sufficient campus ecosystem.' this is not merely about providing accommodation but about creating an environment where students’ primary living, learning, and social interactions occur within the campus boundaries. this internal focus is particularly pronounced given that the surrounding area is often described as offering "nothing much outside the campus" in terms of external social or recreational opportunities.” the policy of "no rules and timings for coming in or going out of hostel" ‘ reinforces

chunk 226 content...
the policy of "no rules and timings for coming in or going out of hostel" ‘ reinforces this internal freedom, as students predominantly exercise this autonomy within the extensive on-campus resources. this means that students are highly reliant on the comprehensive amenities available within the campus, such as night canteens, food courts that operate late into the night, and hall canteens, to support their lifestyle and social activities.* the observation that night canteens in senior halls might close during vacation periods further underscores this reliance on the internal campus infrastructure for daily needs and social life.® ll. halls of residence: names, locations, and facilities iit kharagpur's extensive network of halls of residence provides diverse living environments, each equipped with a range of facilities to support student life. comprehensive list of all halls \it kharagpur boasts 21 halls of residence, collectively designed to accommodate over 12,000 students.* these

' geographical distribution and key locations within campus the majority of student hostels are strategically located on either side of scholars avenue, a significant thoroughfare that extends from the institute's main gate towards the b. c. roy technology hospital. the three oldest halls—patel, azad, and nehru—are collectively known as the "pan loop" or the "old campus," situated in close proximity to scholar's avenue.° this area is known for its established culture and active student life. girls' hostels are intentionally positioned near key campus facilities such as the academic center, playgrounds, the police station, and auditoriums. this deliberate placement prioritizes convenience and safety for female students, ensuring easy access to essential academic, recreational, and security services. lal bahadur shastri (lbs)

' understanding hall dynamics the residential infrastructure at iit kharagpur presents an interesting interplay between the age of the buildings and the vibrancy of student life. the campus features a blend of very old halls, such as patel hall, which was built in 1952 and holds the distinction of being the first iit hostel in india, forming part of the "pan loop".° in contrast, modern halls like lal bahadur shastri (lbs) and madan mohan malviya (mmm) were completed in 2010 and are described as "modern" and "spacious".® however, the perceived quality of a hall experience is not

described as "modern" and "spacious".® however, the perceived quality of a hall experience is not solely determined by the physical age or modernity of the building. older, larger halls such as rajendra prasad (rp), radha krishnan (rk), and azad are noted for having a “much more active student body" and for maintaining "proper maintenance" standards driven by student engagement.’ this active student involvement contributes to a "more fun" culture within these halls, despite their older infrastructure.’ this suggests that the residential experience is significantly shaped by the dynamism of the student community and the effectiveness of student-led governance in fostering a positive environment and ensuring upkeep. therefore, when considering halls, it is important to factor in both the physical attributes and the unique social dynamics associated with each. the strategic placement of girls' hostels is another key aspect of iit kharagpur's residential planning. these halls are

internships, students are encouraged to obtain a no objection certificate (noc) from the cdc and to inform the center of their internship status for record-keeping purposes." while the cdc provides centralized support and enforces policies, the existence of these non-cdc tracks with noc requirements highlights a balanced approach between institutional guidance and student initiative. this balance suggests that the institute trusts students to proactively seek opportunities while maintaining oversight for data collection and potential conflict avoidance. a core policy governing both internships and placements is the “one student one job" principle, meaning that once a student accepts an offer, they are generally removed from further participation in the selection process."° however, specific exceptions exist for certain categories of prestigious research internships, such as those through mitacs or s.n. bose programs." students who apply to a company are generally expected to

allows the student to continue participating in the subsequent placement process." conversely, accepting a ppo means the student is considered "placed" and is no longer eligible to participate in further placement activities.'* this strategic importance of internships is clear, as they serve as a direct pathway to full-time employment, significantly alleviating the pressure of the main placement season for students. this also suggests that companies view internships as an extended, in-depth interview process. pre-placement interviews (ppls) represent an interview opportunity extended by a company to a student who has previously interned with them. the company is required to inform the cdc in advance of their intention to offer a ppi, after which the cdc notifies the student to submit their cv and express their interest.’* while the term "ppi" is explicitly mentioned in the context of llm placements, the broader placement policy refers to “pre-processes" which encompass activities like

and students) are generally discouraged to maintain fairness and efficiency in the process." the detailed policies surrounding these pre-processes, including technical requirements and re-testing protocols, illustrate that the cdc actively manages the recruitment environment to mitigate risks for participating companies. this professional and supportive approach contributes to the high number of returning recruiters and strengthens the institute's industry partnerships. the opportunity to undertake a six-month internship, particularly for postgraduate (pg) students, is recognized as a significant factor in increasing the likelihood of receiving a ppo, thereby reducing the intensity of the on-campus placement process.”' for example, the post graduate diploma in business analytics (pgdba) program boasts a high ppo rate of 70%.” the overall trend in ppos for mba students has shown consistent growth, with 46 ppos in 2024, compared to 41 in 2023 and 34 in 2022.7? across the institute,

is being formed to investigate the underlying causes of student suicides and recommend actionable solutions.’ the direct link between student suicides and these institutional policy reforms underscores a reactive, rather than purely proactive, approach to student well-being. this suggests that the severity of the mental health crisis has necessitated a systemic re-evaluation of existing support systems. the attendance policy itself has been a significant source of stress for students. while some perceive a rigid 75% attendance requirement, others note that the policy's application often depends on individual teachers, creating inconsistency.” instances of de-registration for minor attendance shortages, as little as three percent, have resulted in considerable mental stress and delayed academic progress for undergraduate students in their final year.” this inconsistency in policy application can unintentionally become a source of undue pressure, leading to burnout and anxiety. the

data-driven course recommendation systems. this suggests a strong potential for the institute to leverage this expertise, potentially integrating tools like kronos or building upon them, to move beyond simple cgpa filters for course eligibility. iit knaragpur's academic programs encourage students to explore options irrespective of their admitted discipline, offering multidisciplinary courses, minors, and micro-specializations.*® the credit system also provides students the flexibility to plan their own academic paths.” these flexible academic structures, combined with the identified need for better information and internal technical capabilities, present a significant opportunity for developing a comprehensive course recommendation system. such a system could integrate diverse data points, including student interests (perhaps inferred from academic choices and club participation), historical grade statistics (from kronos or improved erp data), qualitative faculty feedback (if a

historical grade statistics (from kronos or improved erp data), qualitative faculty feedback (if a reliable mechanism is established), and career path aspirations (from cdc data and alumni networks). by integrating these factors, the system could provide personalized guidance, aligning with the "course recommendation systems" aspect of the user query. table 6 outlines the potential components of a comprehensive course recommendation system for iit kharagpur. table 6: components of a comprehensive course recommendation system component data sources purpose/benefit student profile module erp (academic history, cgpa, |personalizes recommendations registered courses), student based on individual academic surveys (interests, career standing, interests, and goals), club/society data laspirations.

the emphasis on individual resilience and proactive engagement with faculty is paramount for students facing academic difficulties. in the realm of internships, a competitive landscape exists, with cgpa and individual projects being critical for securing opportunities, especially in software roles. the rise of remote internships, such as the ieee summer internship, broadens accessibility, but the prevalence of unpaid positions may create equity challenges. crucially, strong alumni networks play an indispensable role in providing mentorship and career guidance beyond official channels. seniors offer pragmatic advice that extends beyond academic excellence, emphasizing holistic development, including extracurricular engagement, health maintenance, and the cultivation of soft skills like leadership and emotional intelligence. branch-specific guidance highlights the early career focus in cse, the diversification of career paths in mechanical engineering, the entrepreneurial spirit in

erp portal.4 furthermore, student mobile applications linked to the erp deliver timely updates and notifications concerning exams, events, assignments, and submissions, enhancing the overall student experience.4 looking ahead, a proposed "kgp nexus" platform aims to further streamline student access to career and academic opportunities. this open-source digital platform is designed to integrate with the erp system for authentication, leveraging iit kgp's email verification for secure access.6 kgp nexus envisions providing students with a dashboard for real-time seminar tracking, a directory of research internship and project opportunities, and live tracking of application statuses (e.g., accepted, rejected, waitlisted).6 this initiative highlights the continuous effort to enhance student services by building upon the foundational erp system. 2.1.3 faculty and staff operations: evaluations, payroll, hr management the erp system extends its comprehensive functionalities to faculty and

chunk 589 content...
payroll, hr management the erp system extends its comprehensive functionalities to faculty and staff, supporting a wide array of operational and human resource management tasks. it facilitates faculty evaluations, ensuring a structured process for performance assessment.4 for hr management, the system efficiently handles payroll processing, hiring procedures, performance reviews, and the centralized management of employee data.4 this capability enables the institute to make informed hr decisions and provide adequate support to its teaching and non-teaching staff.4 moreover, the erp system offers specialized instructor applications that provide up-to-date attendance records, enable checking of answer sheets and assignments, and offer detailed syllabus schedules.4 beyond individual tasks, the erp functions as acentralized forum for departmental cooperation and communication, allowing direct access to projects and facilitating information sharing within a single integrated system,

chunk 590 content...
direct access to projects and facilitating information sharing within a single integrated system, thereby reducing reliance on disparate communication methods like email for internal collaboration.4 it also provides platforms for online discussions, announcements, and assignment updates, fostering seamless communication between faculty and students.4 2.1.4 internet access authentication via erp: captive portal mechanism the erp system plays a critical role in managing internet access across the iit kharagpur campus. both wired and wireless network users are required to authenticate through a web-based captive portal, utilizing their erp login credentials.7 to gain internet access, users must first create a specific "campus network password" within their erp account, found under the "other actions" menu item.’ this unique password, distinct from the primary erp login password, is then used for both wired and wifi authentication. 7 a key operational detail is the 45-day session timeout

chunk 591 content...
for both wired and wifi authentication. 7 a key operational detail is the 45-day session timeout on the captive portal, necessitating re-authentication every 45 days on each connected device to maintain internet connectivity.7 it is important to note that access to local iitkgp resources, such as zimbra mail and official institute websites, does not require this captive portal authentication when accessed from the wired network.7 the pervasive use of the erp system for internet access authentication, in addition to its core administrative and academic functions, underscores its role as the primary identity management system and the central repository for critical institutional data. this means that erp is not merely a tool for managing resources but acts as the foundational layer for user identity and access privileges across various digital services. for kgpt, this implies that secure and authorized access to erp data, or systems that integrate with it, is paramount for providing

chunk 592 content...
and authorized access to erp data, or systems that integrate with it, is paramount for providing accurate and personalized responses related to a user's academic status, personal information, and access to campus resources. any strategy for kgpt's knowledge base must therefore prioritize understanding and securely interacting with the erp system as the single source of truth for user identity and institutional data. 2.1.5 future developments and integrations (e.g., kgp nexus) as previously mentioned, kgp nexus represents a significant future development, envisioned as an open-source digital platform designed to streamline access to career and academic opportunities for iit kharagpur students.6 this platform is planned to integrate directly with the erp system for user authentication, ensuring credibility through iit kgp's email verification.6 kgp nexus aims to offer features such as filtering, tracking applications for job listings, hackathons, and research internships, and providing

chunk 593 content...
tracking applications for job listings, hackathons, and research internships, and providing notifications.6 its promotion is intended to leverage social media platforms and official iit kgp websites, facilitating a gradual transition for students to the new system.6 the development plan includes phases for planning, research (august 2025), design and development (september-december 2025), final testing and launch preparation (january 2026), and continuous improvement (february 2026 onwards).6 table 1: erp system core modules and key user functions module category key functions snippet references faculty, staff, students academic administration student management course management, admissions, academic planning, question bank creation, report card production, exam fee collection centralized student information, course registration, material download, progress monitoring, student mobile app notifications human resources payroll, hiring, performance reviews, employee data finance &

chunk 595 content...
email, calendar, and collaboration solution.9 for students enrolled from the 2020-21 autumn session onwards, g-suite (now google workspace) is utilized for mail services.9 the computer & informatics centre (cic) centrally manages both mail messaging facilities.9 new students joining in the 2024-2025 autumn session receive their institute email ids (e.g., kgpian.iitkgp.ac.in domain), with the default password (otp) updated in their respective erp profiles for initial access.9 these institute email ids are active until one year after the convocation process, after which they are deleted. a lifetime alumni mail id with limited storage space is subsequently provided to former students." 2.2.2 cloud storage solutions: google drive and onedrive policies the institute's approach to cloud storage presents a nuanced landscape. iit kharagpur students are reportedly allotted 100gb of cloud storage in onedrive, which can be accessed by signing up with their institute email address.12 this access,

chunk 596 content...
in onedrive, which can be accessed by signing up with their institute email address.12 this access, however, is contingent on the institute email address remaining active, typically until graduation.12 despite this provision, the computer & informatics centre (cic) explicitly states that the institute only provides microsoft teams accounts and does not officially support other online microsoft products, including office 365 or onedrive. this implies that users who utilize these services do so at their own risk.11 regarding google drive, some study materials are noted to be available on google drive.12 however, a significant policy shift for alumni has been observed, where google drive storage decreased from unlimited to a mere 500mb, with former students expressing frustration over the lack of prior notification from iit regarding this change.13 this situation highlights a notable difference between the availability of a service and the official support or long-term policy surrounding

chunk 597 content...
between the availability of a service and the official support or long-term policy surrounding it. the institute's explicit declaration of non-support for certain services, even while they are accessible or historically used, suggests a division between formally endorsed it services and those that users might leverage independently. this distinction is critical for kgpt to convey, as it affects the reliability of support and the longevity of data stored on these platforms. kgpt should inform users that while services like onedrive or google drive might be accessible through institute accounts, official technical assistance from cic is limited for non-supported products. it should also advise users to be aware of dynamic storage policies, especially for alumni, and recommend proactive data backup to personal cloud services for long-term retention. 2.2.3 collaboration and productivity tools: google calendar integration (e.g., class-kgp) while comprehensive details on the general usage

chunk 598 content...
google calendar integration (e.g., class-kgp) while comprehensive details on the general usage of g-suite collaboration tools are not extensively provided, there is evidence of practical integration within the iit kharagpur ecosystem. a notable example is "class-kgp," a chrome extension specifically designed to enhance student academic organization.14 this tool seamlessly retrieves a student's timetable from the erp portal and automatically generates corresponding events in google calendar, complete with crucial details such as class times and venues.14 this integration aims to simplify academic scheduling and improve student productivity by automating the transfer of timetable information into a widely used personal organization tool.14 google calendar itself offers standard functionalities for scheduling meetings, inviting guests, attaching files, and setting reminders, which are broadly applicable for academic and personal organization.15 2.2.4 general it infrastructure usage

chunk 599 content...
broadly applicable for academic and personal organization.15 2.2.4 general it infrastructure usage policies (applicability to gsuite) all digital services, including gsuite, fall under the institute's general it infrastructure usage policies. these policies stipulate that the it infrastructure is primarily intended for academic and official purposes, with only a limited allowance for reasonable personal use.10 users bear the sole responsibility for any data stored or transmitted using the institute's it infrastructure, and any liability arising from misuse rests with the individual user.10 key security mandates include the use of strong passwords for all accounts, including email, and the immediate reporting of any suspected or known security breaches to the computer & informatics centre (cic).10 users are also explicitly cautioned against sharing their account details or opening suspicious emails and attachments, as cic will never request password information via email.10 the

chunk 600 content...
suspicious emails and attachments, as cic will never request password information via email.10 the emphasis on user responsibility for data backup, account security, and adherence to usage policies, particularly when considering the hybrid it environment where some services are provided but not fully supported, highlights a significant aspect of the institute's digital governance. this framework places considerable accountability on the end-user for their digital activities and data management, especially concerning services that may not fall under explicit official support. kgpt should therefore be designed to inform users about these responsibilities, particularly when discussing cloud storage or third-party integrations. it should recommend best practices for password management and data backup, aligning with the institute's policy of user accountability to mitigate potential issues arising from unsupported service usage. 2.3 microsoft teams 2.3.1 official provision and account

chunk 601 content...
arising from unsupported service usage. 2.3 microsoft teams 2.3.1 official provision and account management policies lit kharagpur officially provides microsoft teams accounts to its community members.11 however, the computer & informatics centre (cic) explicitly clarifies that while teams accounts are supported, the institute does not provide support for other online microsoft products, such as microsoft office 365 or onedrive. users who choose to utilize these additional microsoft online services do so at their own risk.11 a key policy regarding account longevity is that microsoft teams accounts for students are deleted immediately after their convocation process.'° 2.3.2 role in virtual classrooms and online meetings microsoft teams for education is recognized as a robust communication application that significantly enhances collaboration and learning experiences within schools.16 it integrates essential functionalities such as video collaboration, chat, assignment management, and

integrates essential functionalities such as video collaboration, chat, assignment management, and the sharing of class materials and notes directly within the application."® teams facilitates virtual classrooms and online meetings, allowing for features like scheduling meetings, inviting participants, sharing screens, and recording sessions." teachers leverage teams for various academic interactions, including delivering lectures, conducting doubt-clearing sessions, organizing tutorials, and managing assignments. 21 the platform also supports automated attendance tracking when meetings are generated through specific learning platform integrations.19 2.3.3 integration with microsoft 365 and supported features as an integral component of the broader microsoft 365 suite, microsoft teams combines chat, video conferencing, file sharing, and application integration into a unified interface designed to streamline teamwork and boost productivity.17 it offers features such as channel-based

chunk 603 content...
designed to streamline teamwork and boost productivity.17 it offers features such as channel-based organization, robust file sharing and collaboration capabilities, and accessibility through both mobile and desktop applications.17 users can also integrate third-party applications like trello or asana to further enhance workflows.17 the institute's approach to microsoft teams demonstrates a strategic adoption of specific tools within broader software ecosystems. while iit kharagpur provides and supports microsoft teams for its core communication and virtual classroom functionalities, it explicitly limits its official support to this specific application, not extending it to other components of microsoft 365 like onedrive or office 365.11 this selective endorsement suggests a deliberate choice, possibly influenced by cost considerations, existing g-suite infrastructure for email, or a focus on particular core functionalities that teams excels at. for kgpt, this distinction is vital. the

chunk 604 content...
on particular core functionalities that teams excels at. for kgpt, this distinction is vital. the al assistant should clearly communicate that while teams is an officially supported platform for communication and online learning, users should be aware that broader microsoft 365 services, even if accessible, do not receive the same level of institutional support. this differentiation is crucial for providing accurate guidance on technical assistance and data management practices. 3. official communication channels and announcement mechanisms 3.1 primary digital communication channels 3.1.1 official email communications (policies and best practices) official email serves as a primary and formal communication channel within iit kharagpur. the email facility provided by the institute is intended predominantly for academic and official purposes, with a limited allowance for reasonable personal use.10 the computer & informatics centre (cic) holds central responsibility for managing the

chunk 605 content...
use.10 the computer & informatics centre (cic) holds central responsibility for managing the institute's mail messaging system.9 users are advised to take responsibility for backing up important emails in their accounts, although cic does perform periodic email backups, it does not assume responsibility for data loss in user accounts.10 security and proper usage are emphasized: users are strictly cautioned against sharing their email account details, as the individual account holder is personally accountable for any misuse.10 furthermore, users are prohibited from attempting to access others’ email accounts and must exercise extreme caution when opening emails or attachments from unknown or suspicious sources, verifying authenticity before proceeding.10 a critical best practice highlighted is never to provide confidential information, such as passwords, in response to any email, as cic explicitly states it will never ask for such details via email.10 for new students (e.g., 2024-2025

chunk 606 content...
explicitly states it will never ask for such details via email.10 for new students (e.g., 2024-2025 autumn session), institute email ids are created and their default passwords updated in their erp profiles.9 these institute email ids are typically deleted one year after the convocation process, after which a lifetime alumni mail id with limited storage space is provided.'° the detailed policies surrounding email usage, security, and retention underscore its role as the primary formal and auditable communication channel within the institute. this robust framework for email management indicates a high reliance on this medium for critical information dissemination, making its security and proper use paramount for all members of the iit kharagpur community. for kgpt, this means that email should be considered the most authoritative source for official announcements and policy updates. kgpt should be capable of processing and summarizing email communications, and potentially alerting

chunk 607 content...
kgpt should be capable of processing and summarizing email communications, and potentially alerting users to important policy changes or deadlines found within these communications. it could also offer guidance on identifying and avoiding phishing attempts, aligning with the institute’s best practices. 3.1.2 institute official website and central announcement systems the primary online presence for iit kharagpur is its official website, located at www.iitkgp.ac.in.' while a single, centralized "central announcement system" section on the main website is not explicitly detailed as a distinct feature in the provided information, the institute's communication strategy involves a distributed network of information dissemination. various departmental and administrative units maintain their own dedicated "notice boards" and "news & announcements" sections on their respective sub-sites. for instance, the hall management centre (hmc) features a "notices" page for circulars and announcements

chunk 608 content...
the hall management centre (hmc) features a "notices" page for circulars and announcements pertinent to hostel residents and operations, including details on minimum wages, vendor registration, guest meal charges, guidelines for research scholars, and anti-ragging measures. 22 archived notices are also accessible through the hmc portal, providing a historical record of communications.23 similarly, the advanced technology development centre (atdc) maintains its own "notice board" for relevant announcements.” beyond these internal portals, news and updates concerning admissions, placements, and rankings are frequently published on external educational news platforms that cover iit kharagpur.”° the kgp chronicle, an internal news source, also serves as a platform for official news and updates.”’ this distributed approach to announcements, where information is disseminated across the main institute website, various departmental sub-sites, and official news outlets, indicates that while

chunk 609 content...
institute website, various departmental sub-sites, and official news outlets, indicates that while core institutional information is available, specific or localized announcements are often managed autonomously by the relevant units. for kgpt, this implies that a comprehensive understanding of announcements requires aggregating information from this network of official sub-domains and departmental portals, rather than relying solely on a single central page. kgpt would need to discern which specific portal is most relevant for a given type of announcement, for example, directing queries about hostel policies to the hmc website, or general admission updates to the main institute news sections. 3.2 supplementary digital communication channels 3.2.1 departmental and hall-specific notice boards and circulars (e.g., hmc, atdc) as highlighted, specific administrative bodies and academic centers within iit kharagpur maintain their own dedicated online notice boards and archives for

chunk 610 content...
centers within iit kharagpur maintain their own dedicated online notice boards and archives for circulars. the hall management centre (hmc) provides a comprehensive "notices" page where circulars and notices are published, covering a range of topics from administrative updates like minimum wages and vendor registration to student-specific information such as guest meal charges, guidelines for research scholars residing in halls, and anti-ragging measures.22 an archive of past notices is also available, offering a historical record of communications.23 similarly, the advanced technology development centre (atdc) features its own "notice board" for its specific announcements.” these localized portals are crucial for disseminating information relevant to their immediate communities, ensuring that specific groups receive pertinent updates efficiently. 3.2.2 official social media presence (youtube, facebook, twitter, linkedin) iit kharagpur actively maintains an official presence across

chunk 611 content...
(youtube, facebook, twitter, linkedin) iit kharagpur actively maintains an official presence across various social media platforms to engage with its community and the wider public. the institute operates an official youtube channel, "@litkharagpuronline," which hosts a significant number of videos and has a substantial subscriber base, indicating its use for video content dissemination.’ beyond youtube, iit kharagpur also maintains official pages on facebook (@iit.kgp), twitter (@iitkgp), instagram (@iit.kgp), and linkedin (indian institute of technology).”’ these platforms serve as channels for general news dissemination, event publicity, outreach activities, and showcasing institute achievements.”° for example, the kgp chronicle, an internal news source, encourages following these social media channels for updates. 29 3.2.3 innovative outreach: qr codes for student support in a proactive and innovative move to enhance student well-being, iit kharagpur has implemented a unique

chunk 612 content...
proactive and innovative move to enhance student well-being, iit kharagpur has implemented a unique communication strategy by placing qr codes on the doors of every hostel room.33 these qr codes are accompanied by supportive messages such as "let's talk! scan to connect" and "every problem has a solution. let's find it together".33 the initiative is designed to provide students with easy and private access to a range of support systems, including resources, helpline numbers, and counseling services, particularly addressing mental health concerns.33 this method is crucial for maintaining student privacy while enabling them to access vital online facilities and information, especially during odd hours when direct contact might be challenging.33 this approach demonstrates the institute's recognition of the need for diverse and easily accessible communication strategies tailored to student welfare, moving beyond traditional one-way information dissemination. for kgpt, understanding this

chunk 613 content...
welfare, moving beyond traditional one-way information dissemination. for kgpt, understanding this proactive engagement means that the al should not only retrieve information but also grasp the underlying purpose of such communication methods. when addressing sensitive topics like student support, kgpt could prioritize directing users to easily accessible and private resources, mirroring the proactive and discreet nature of the qr code initiative. it also highlights the importance of respecting user privacy in sensitive interactions. 3.3 communication policies and guidelines 3.3.1 institute it security and usage policies the overarching principle governing the use of iit kharagpur's it infrastructure is its primary allocation for academic purposes of the iit community.10 strict prohibitions are in place against using the infrastructure for commercial purposes without explicit permission or in any manner that compromises the security of any user, system, or network, whether internal or

chunk 614 content...
or in any manner that compromises the security of any user, system, or network, whether internal or external to the institute.10 users are held solely responsible for all data stored or transmitted using the institute's it resources, and any liability arising from misuse rests entirely with the individual user.10 furthermore, policies mandate the use of strong passwords for all institute accounts, including email, and require immediate reporting of any suspected or confirmed password disclosure or security breaches to the systems administrator or departmental security representative.10 3.3.2 faculty guidelines on media and public statements iit kharagpur maintains stringent guidelines concerning faculty members’ engagement with media and public statements, reflecting a clear institutional strategy for reputation management and consistent external communication. faculty members are explicitly prohibited from making any statement to the press, issuing letters (even anonymously), or

chunk 615 content...
prohibited from making any statement to the press, issuing letters (even anonymously), or participating in any radio broadcast without prior permission from the college administration.34 this policy extends to comments made on social media, particularly those that could be perceived as adverse criticism of institute policies or actions, or which might cause embarrassment in the institute's relations with central or state governments.34 any articles contributed by faculty must be strictly confined to purely scientific subjects, avoiding administrative matters and political connotations.34 this controlled approach to external communication indicates a strong institutional desire to manage its public narrative and ensure that all official statements are authorized and aligned with the institute's objectives. for kgpt, this implies that when providing information on sensitive topics or official positions, the al should prioritize data directly from the institute's official website or

chunk 616 content...
official positions, the al should prioritize data directly from the institute's official website or authorized spokespersons. it should avoid relying on individual faculty statements unless those statements are explicitly published or endorsed through official institute channels, thereby ensuring the accuracy and official nature of the information conveyed. 3.4 role of community-driven and unofficial channels 3.4.1 whatsapp groups: usage and official stance (if any) while the provided institutional it policies do not explicitly list whatsapp as an official communication channel or detail a specific policy for its institute-wide use 10, its presence within the iit kharagpur communication landscape is undeniable. a reddit post, for instance, refers to an "official iit kharagpur whatsapp community" specifically for freshers, managed by students who require allotment letters for verification to join.35 this suggests that while the institute itself may not directly manage whatsapp as a

to join.35 this suggests that while the institute itself may not directly manage whatsapp as a primary broadcast channel, it implicitly acknowledges or permits student-led "official" communities for specific, niche purposes, such as new student onboarding or hall-level coordination. news articles also mention "whatsapp channel" as a means for receiving education industry updates, indicating its common use for information dissemination among the broader community.36 the existence of these community-driven whatsapp groups, even with a "verified" or "official" label applied by students, illustrates a hybrid communication environment. it shows that practical communication needs, particularly within specific student cohorts, are often met through widely adopted and convenient platforms like whatsapp. this occurs even when the institution maintains formal, policy-driven channels. this dynamic points to the emergence of semi-official or community-driven channels that fill gaps in formal

chunk 618 content...
points to the emergence of semi-official or community-driven channels that fill gaps in formal communication, often with a degree of implicit institutional acceptance or student-led initiative. kgpt should acknowledge the utility and prevalence of these whatsapp groups for certain types of community-specific information, such as fresher onboarding details or informal hall updates. however, it is crucial for kgpt to also advise users that information from these channels might not always be officially vetted or comprehensive. therefore, for critical announcements or policy details, users should always be directed to cross-reference information with primary official sources like official emails, the erp system, or the main institute website to ensure accuracy and reliability. table 2: official communication channels and their primary uses channel type official email institute official website (www.iitkgp.ac.in) departmental/hall notice boards (e.g., hmc, atdc) official social media

and serve distinct purposes at different points in the academic term. midterm evaluations are designed to provide formative feedback, distributed around the midpoint of a semester (typically six weeks after classes begin). the results of these evaluations are shared exclusively with the instructors, allowing them to make immediate course adjustments if necessary.41 end-of-course (eoc) evaluations, conversely, gather summative feedback at the term's conclusion, with results generally made available to instructors only after final grades have been submitted.41 the evaluation surveys incorporate a standard set of "core" questions, which have been approved by the university faculty council. additionally, some academic units and programs may include supplementary questions specific to their discipline.41 the iit-kgp erp system is utilized for collecting this student feedback and conducting course evaluations, employing a 5-point scale where 1 signifies "poor" and 5 signifies

helpfulness and approachability.42 the collective feedback from these evaluations contributes to an overall rating of the teacher, providing a comprehensive view of their teaching effectiveness.42 4.2.3 academic performance tracking (sgpa/cgpa calculation) academic performance at iit kharagpur is meticulously tracked through standardized metrics like sgpa (semester grade point average) and cgpa (cumulative grade point average). the erp system centrally manages all student information, including grades, which form the basis for these calculations.4 sgpa measures a student's academic performance for a specific semester, calculated by averaging the grade points earned in courses during that period. cgpa, on the other hand, represents a student's overall academic performance, averaging grade points earned across all courses over multiple semesters.43 an online cgpa calculator is available for iit kharagpur students, offering a user-friendly tool to calculate current cgpa and project

chunk 631 content...
for iit kharagpur students, offering a user-friendly tool to calculate current cgpa and project future outcomes, with the flexibility to adapt to different university grading systems.43 beyond individual student performance, the institute's senate plays a crucial role in academic governance. it continuously assesses academic programs and implements necessary revisions, modifications, or improvements through specialized institute-level senate subcommittees, such as the under-graduate program evaluation committee (ugpec) and the post-graduate program evaluation committee.44 the comprehensive nature of the course evaluation system, the erp's role in managing faculty and student performance data, and the availability of tools like gpa calculators collectively highlight a strong emphasis on data-driven academic governance and student self-assessment. this structured approach ensures that quantitative metrics are central to evaluating teaching effectiveness, student progress, and the

and initiatives 4.3.1 surveys for policy reforms and development (e.g., attendance policy) \it kharagpur actively utilizes surveys and data collection to inform and drive institutional policy reforms. a prime example is the ongoing discussion and efforts to tweak the attendance policy. the institute's management has undertaken surveys and gathered statistics to understand the number of students being de-registered and the subjects with high failure rates. this data-driven approach aims to ease academic load and strike a better balance between academics and student well-being, particularly in response to concerns about mental stress.36 this demonstrates a commitment to evidence-based policy-making and a responsive administration. 4.3.2 surveys for platform development (e.g., kgp nexus) user feedback is a crucial component in the development of new digital platforms at lit kharagpur. for the proposed kgp nexus platform, which aims to streamline access to career and academic

chunk 635 content...
for the proposed kgp nexus platform, which aims to streamline access to career and academic opportunities, surveys are explicitly conducted among both students and faculty. the purpose of these surveys is to thoroughly understand user needs and identify the key features required for the platform's successful development.6 this user-centric approach ensures that new digital tools are designed to effectively meet the practical requirements of the iit kharagpur community. 4.3.3 virtual lab feedback systems the virtual labs (vlab) initiative at iit kharagpur incorporates a dedicated online feedback system to continuously improve its offerings. users of the virtual labs can provide detailed input on various aspects of the experiments, including their confidence in performing them, the motivational quality of the experiment, the accuracy of the simulated lab environment, and the overall helpfulness of the system.45 this feedback mechanism is a direct channel for users to highlight problems

chunk 636 content...
of the system.45 this feedback mechanism is a direct channel for users to highlight problems encountered and suggest improvements, ensuring that the virtual lab experiences are continuously refined based on user interaction and needs.45 the consistent reliance on surveys for policy reforms, platform development, and virtual lab improvements underscores an institutional commitment to iterative development and continuous enhancement across its operations. this robust feedback loop is vital for iit kharagpur to adapt to the evolving needs of its community and address systemic challenges effectively. for kgpt, this implies that the al assistant should be aware that institutional policies and digital platforms are dynamic and subject to change based on stakeholder feedback. kgpt could potentially inform users about relevant survey opportunities or explain how their input contributes to improvements, thereby reinforcing the perception of a responsive and adaptive administration within iit

chunk 637 content...
thereby reinforcing the perception of a responsive and adaptive administration within iit kharagpur. 5. conclusion and strategic recommendations for kgpt 5.1 synthesis of iit knaragpur's communication and portal landscape iit kharagpur operates within a sophisticated and multi-layered digital communication and portal ecosystem. the enterprise resource planning (erp) system stands as the central administrative and data backbone, seamlessly integrating academic, student, human resources, and financial functions. its role extends even to critical infrastructure like internet access authentication, underscoring its foundational importance. official communication within the institute is primarily driven by email, which serves as the formal record and primary channel for critical announcements and policy dissemination. this is complemented by a distributed network of departmental websites and online notice boards, reflecting a blend of centralized policy oversight and decentralized

chunk 638 content...
and online notice boards, reflecting a blend of centralized policy oversight and decentralized operational communication tailored to specific communities. while formal policies stringently govern official statements, particularly concerning faculty engagement with media, and dictate it usage, there is also an observable presence of semi-official or community-driven channels. platforms like whatsapp groups, especially for freshers, fulfill specific, often informal, communication needs, even if they are not explicitly managed or fully supported by the central administration. the institute further demonstrates a proactive and adaptive approach to student welfare through innovative outreach methods, such as the use of qr codes for discreet access to mental health support. a structured framework for feedback, academic evaluations, and grievance redressal is also firmly in place, emphasizing confidentiality for sensitive issues and leveraging collected data for continuous institutional

chunk 639 content...
confidentiality for sensitive issues and leveraging collected data for continuous institutional improvement. the analysis reveals that the concept of "official" communication at iit kharagpur is not a singular, monolithic entity. instead, it is a multi-faceted and context-dependent construct. it encompasses highly formal, policy-driven channels like the erp and official emails, alongside more distributed departmental announcements and even implicitly sanctioned community-driven platforms. the level of authority and reliability of information varies significantly depending on its source and context. this complex landscape requires a nuanced understanding to navigate effectively. for kgpt, this means developing a sophisticated internal logic to discern the most authoritative source for any given query. the al assistant must be capable of differentiating between core institutional policies and localized operational information, and providing nuanced advice on the reliability and

chunk 640 content...
policies and localized operational information, and providing nuanced advice on the reliability and appropriate use of various communication channels. this comprehensive understanding is essential for kgpt to serve as a truly effective and accurate knowledge base for the iit kharagpur community. 5.2 strategic recommendations for kgpt knowledge base integration and data sourcing based on the comprehensive analysis of iit kharagpur's digital communication and portal landscape, the following strategic recommendations are put forth for the development and integration of kgpt's knowledge base: prioritize erp data integration: kgpt should establish secure and authorized interfaces to the erp system. this is crucial for accessing and interpreting core academic records, personal profiles, administrative statuses, and other critical institutional data, given erp's role as the central data repository and identity management layer. develop a hierarchical communication map: the knowledge base

chunk 641 content...
and identity management layer. develop a hierarchical communication map: the knowledge base should incorporate a structured map of official communication channels. this map should clearly distinguish between central institute-wide announcements (e.g., main website, official emails) and more localized, departmental, or hall-specific notices. kgpt should be able to identify and retrieve information from the most relevant source for a given query. differentiate official support from general usage: kgpt must explicitly clarify the institute's official support policies for various digital tools. for instance, while microsoft teams is officially provided, kgpt should inform users that other microsoft 365 products like onedrive are utilized at their own risk, as they do not receive direct institutional support. similarly, it should highlight the dynamic nature of cloud storage policies for gsuite accounts, especially for alumni. leverage structured feedback and evaluation data: integrate

chunk 642 content...
gsuite accounts, especially for alumni. leverage structured feedback and evaluation data: integrate data from course evaluations, faculty evaluations, and grievance mechanisms into kgpt's knowledge base. this will enable the al to provide insights into academic quality, support systems, and the impact of student feedback on institutional improvements. acknowledge and contextualize semi-official channels: while not primary sources, kgpt should acknowledge the existence and practical utility of community-driven platforms like whatsapp groups for specific, informal communication needs. however, it is vital to include appropriate disclaimers about their unofficial or semi-official status, advising users to cross-verify critical information with primary official sources. implement contextual sensitivity for sensitive queries: kgpt should be trained to recognize and handle sensitive user queries (e.g., related to mental health, harassment, or ragging) with utmost care. it should be

chunk 643 content...
queries (e.g., related to mental health, harassment, or ragging) with utmost care. it should be programmed to direct users to the appropriate confidential and specialized support mechanisms, emphasizing the institute's commitment to privacy and support for such issues. design for dynamic policy updates: given that iit kharagpur utilizes surveys and feedback for continuous improvement and policy reforms (e.g., attendance policy changes), kgpt's knowledge base must be designed for regular and efficient updates. this ensures that the al assistant provides the most current and accurate information, reflecting the evolving landscape of institutional policies references wor 1. 2. and digital services. ks cited iit kharagpur - wikipedia, accessed on june 22, 2025, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iit_ kharagour indian institute of technology (iit), kharagpur - high commision of india, kingston, jamaica, accessed on june 22, 2025, https://hcikingston.gov.in/pages/mtk, about kharagpur | software

academic recovery at iit kharagpur: navigating backlogs, leaves, and comebacks iit kharagpur’s undergraduate journey can be rigorous, and it’s not uncommon for students to face academic setbacks such as failed courses (backlogs), missed exams, or extended delays due to health or personal issues. unfortunately, these issues are often under-discussed, leaving affected students feeling isolated or hopeless. this deep-dive aims to bring those “hidden” academic recovery issues into the light – outlining official institute policies and sharing real student experiences – to reassure students that “you’re not alone, and it’s not the end.” we’ll explore backlogs, re-exams, medical leaves, administrative steps, mental health challenges, and inspiring comeback stories, with an emphasis on undergraduate (ug) cases. backlogs & repeat exams backlog is the term used when a student fails or does not complete a subject, resulting in an “f” grade that must be cleared later. here’s what iit kharagpur’s

a subject, resulting in an “f” grade that must be cleared later. here’s what iit kharagpur’s rules say and what students experience: what happens when you fail a subject: if you get an ‘f’ grade in any course (theory or project), that subject becomes a backlog and must be cleared to fulfill your degree requirements erp.iitkgp.ac.in . this applies even to project courses or labs – e.g. failing the b.tech project part-1 counts as a backlog erp.iitkgp.ac.in . an “unregistered” required subject (one you skipped or couldn’t register for) is also treated as a backlog until you complete it erp.iitkgp.ac.in . in short, any required course not successfully completed is added to your backlog count. clearing backlogs – full course vs. only exam: iit kgp provides two main avenues to clear a failed course: re-register for the full course: you can take the course again in a later semester or in the compressed summer quarter term. the summer quarter is a 7-week term after the spring semester where

compressed summer quarter term. the summer quarter is a 7-week term after the spring semester where theory courses are offered for students to make up deficiencies erp.iitkgp.ac.in erp.iitkgp.ac.in . you’re eligible if you appeared in the end-semester exam and got ‘f’ erp.iitkgp.ac.in . (if you missed the exam due to serious illness or family calamity, you can also join summer quarter for that course with proper approval erp.iitkgp.ac.in .) in summer quarter you attend classes, meet the usual attendance requirement, and take exams again erp.iitkgp.ac.in erp.iitkgp.ac.in . note that not all courses are offered every summer; it depends on demand and institute decision (typically a course runs if a minimum number of students register). if summer quarter isn’t available or you prefer, you can instead repeat the course in a regular semester with the next batch. supplementary examination (exam re-attempt): for certain cases, you can re-attempt only the end-semester exam without retaking the

re-attempt): for certain cases, you can re-attempt only the end-semester exam without retaking the full course. iit kharagpur conducts supplementary exams in july (before the next session) for students who failed a subject by getting f in the end-sem exam erp.iitkgp.ac.in . however, since 2016 the scope of these exams is limited: only first-year and final-year students who got an ‘f’ are allowed to use the supplementary exam route erp.iitkgp.ac.in . students in 2nd or 3rd year who fail a course are not eligible for a supplementary exam and must re-take the course (summer or later). an exception is if you missed the end-sem exam for genuine reasons – in that case, any year student can be allowed a one-time re-exam with full grading (see make-up exams below) erp.iitkgp.ac.in . the bottom line: if you simply fail an exam, only freshers and graduating students get the “just re-take exam” option; others will need to repeat the course. supplementary exam mechanics and penalty: the

. this one-grade-down rule does not apply if your case was approved for “full credit” (e.g. you missed the exam due to medical reasons) erp.iitkgp.ac.in . essentially, the institute wants to give a second chance but with a slight gpa penalty for those who simply failed initially (to encourage proper course completion in regular term) erp.iitkgp.ac.in . academic credit limits with backlogs: when you have backlogs, iitkgp controls your course load to prevent overload. by rule, you must register backlog courses first before adding new ones erp.iitkgp.ac.in . if you have more than one backlog in a semester, your total credits that semester (including the backlogs) is capped at 28 erp.iitkgp.ac.in (or even 20 if you are repeating an entire year) erp.iitkgp.ac.in . academically weak students (defined as cgpa < 6.0 or >2 backlogs) have stricter limits erp.iitkgp.ac.in erp.iitkgp.ac.in : they can take at most 21 credits (with a possible extension to 23 on dean’s approval) and usually cannot

can take at most 21 credits (with a possible extension to 23 on dean’s approval) and usually cannot opt for extras like a second project or elective without permission erp.iitkgp.ac.in erp.iitkgp.ac.in . for instance, if you’re in the “weak” category, you might be barred from registering that cool elective until you clear your core backlogs, unless you appeal. one student shared that writing a letter to the dean (through your faculty advisor and head of dept) explaining your situation can get you permission to take required electives even if you’re behind reddit.com . in fact, hostel and gymkhana student representatives (like the general secretary for welfare) can help you draft the request and guide the process reddit.com , which highlights that case-by-case exceptions are possible when academically weak students show commitment to improve. impact on cgpa and graduation: backlogs will obviously affect your cgpa since an ‘f’ is factored in as 0 points until replaced. clearing a

will obviously affect your cgpa since an ‘f’ is factored in as 0 points until replaced. clearing a backlog improves your grade, but remember that if done via supplementary exam, the grade drop rule means you can’t score higher than a “p” or “d” for a borderline pass case erp.iitkgp.ac.in . if you retake the full course in a later semester or summer, you can earn any grade based on performance (with no automatic penalty). either way, once you pass, the new grade counts in your gpa and the “f” is essentially overwritten (though transcripts may show that you took the course twice). the degree requirement is that you must eventually pass all required courses and attain at least the minimum cgpa for graduation (which is 5.0 for pass degree, though 6.0 is needed for honors or certain programs). the institute gives you up to 8 years to finish a 4-year b.tech erp.iitkgp.ac.in erp.iitkgp.ac.in , so even if you fall a year or two behind, you still have the chance to complete your degree. in

, so even if you fall a year or two behind, you still have the chance to complete your degree. in extreme cases of poor performance, a year-back can occur (essentially repeating the year), but iit kgp tries to avoid that with measures like summer courses and credit limits. notably, final-year students with just a couple of backlogs can be allowed overload in their last semester to finish on time (max two extra courses if cgpa ≥ 6.0) erp.iitkgp.ac.in . this is to help you graduate without extension if you are capable and only slightly behind. which courses commonly see backlogs? while official data isn’t published, anecdotally some departments and courses are notorious for high failure rates. for example, tough core courses in certain branches (say, advanced math or electronics courses) can trip up many students. a linkedin commenter quipped that “ma214 is a tough course” after an iit student admitted failing it five times linkedin.com . in general, first-year courses (like math,

student admitted failing it five times linkedin.com . in general, first-year courses (like math, physics, basic electronics) sometimes yield multiple fs, as newcomers adjust to the iit pace. core engineering subjects like thermodynamics, data structures, or control systems can also be challenging – upperclassmen often warn juniors about these. that said, backlogs can happen in any discipline if circumstances go awry (health issues, personal problems, or simply underestimating a course). it’s important to remember that you’re not the only one – every batch has some students with backlogs, even if few talk about it openly. placement restrictions due to backlogs: a common concern is whether having backlogs or a low gpa will hurt internship/job prospects. it’s true that many companies set eligibility criteria like a minimum cgpa (often 7.0 or 8.0+) and “no active backlogs” for campus recruitment reddit.com . “no active backlog” means you should not have any course left uncleared by the

reddit.com . “no active backlog” means you should not have any course left uncleared by the time of the selection process. in campus placements at iit kgp, the career development centre (cdc) typically does not allow students with uncleared backlogs to sit for placements unless those backlogs will be cleared by graduation. however, the enforcement can vary – students have reported that some companies don’t strictly check backlog status during placement applications reddit.com . one student shared that he knew someone who got placed despite having one backlog, as the company didn’t notice and the student cleared it the next semester reddit.com . similarly, for internship interviews, cdc “rarely verifies” backlogs on record, so a second-year with an f in an extra academic activity (ncc/nso) was told “you’re good to go” for intern hiring reddit.com . the safer approach is to clear your backlogs before the placement season if possible. having a backlog can indirectly hurt because it often

before the placement season if possible. having a backlog can indirectly hurt because it often comes with a lower cgpa, and many top recruiters cut off at 7.0 or 8.0 cgpa reddit.com reddit.com . additionally, if your graduation gets delayed (say you need an extra semester or year), you might miss the main placement cycle of your batch and have to interview off-cycle or with the next batch. in one real case, a kgp student lost a pre-placement offer (ppo) from a company because he had to stay an extra semester to finish backlogs sushovanhaldar.medium.com . the company rescinded the offer when they realized he wouldn’t graduate with his cohort sushovanhaldar.medium.com . the good news: once you do clear your backlogs and meet the criteria, you become eligible again, and plenty of students with past academic issues still land good jobs (more on that in alumni stories below). if you’re in the placement process with a past backlog, be prepared to explain what you learned from it if asked –

placement process with a past backlog, be prepared to explain what you learned from it if asked – some interviewers might actually value the resilience as long as you recovered. key takeaway: the institute provides structured ways to recover academically from failures – use them. whether it’s a supplementary exam, a summer course, or an extra semester, a few bad grades do not doom your career. you should, however, plan carefully (with your faculty advisor’s guidance) how to distribute your course load and clear backlogs without burning out. many have walked this road before – backlogs can be overcome with a smart strategy and persistent effort. medical & mental health leaves serious medical problems or mental health issues can disrupt academics, and iit kharagpur has policies to accommodate such situations. if you’re ill or facing psychological challenges, it’s crucial to know your options rather than “push through” and risk failing courses. here’s how the system works for medical and

rather than “push through” and risk failing courses. here’s how the system works for medical and mental health leaves: short-term medical leave (within a semester): if you fall sick during the semester (e.g. dengue, injury, etc.), you are allowed to take medical leave up to one month without losing your semester erp.iitkgp.ac.in . before leaving campus for treatment or rest, you (or a friend) should inform the b.c. roy technology hospital on campus erp.iitkgp.ac.in . the institute hospital’s record will legitimize your absence. once you recover and before rejoining classes, you must get a fitness certificate from b.c. roy hospital to ensure you are medically fit to resume erp.iitkgp.ac.in . if your medical leave exceeds one month, it enters a gray area – the institute will consider your rejoining on a case-by-case basis and this requires approval at the senate level erp.iitkgp.ac.in . in other words, more than ~4 weeks of absence might lead to withdrawing from the semester (temporary

other words, more than ~4 weeks of absence might lead to withdrawing from the semester (temporary suspension of studies) unless special permission is granted to continue. always keep all doctor/hospital paperwork; you’ll need those documents to justify your absences or any requests for make-up exams. temporary withdrawal (semester withdrawal): for prolonged illnesses (physical or mental) or acute personal problems, iit kharagpur allows students to temporarily withdraw from the institute for a semester or more erp.iitkgp.ac.in . this is essentially taking a semester off without academic penalty. key points about semester withdrawal: it’s intended for serious situations where you cannot continue classes – e.g. you’re hospitalized for surgery, undergoing extended therapy, or a major family crisis requires you to be home. you (or your guardian) must apply in writing within 15 days from the semester start (or from your last attended class) explaining the reasons and attaching supporting

reasons, you need to be declared fit by b.c. roy hospital before resuming classes erp.iitkgp.ac.in . taking a semester off can be much better than staying and failing multiple courses. if you’re unable to study, a voluntary withdrawal saves your gpa from a string of f’s and gives you a fresh start later. as one kgp alumnus advised, “sometimes it’s better to step back and heal rather than accumulate damage”. remember, the goal is to finish strong, not just finish fast. medical documentation for exams: if illness strikes around exam time (e.g. you get sick during end-semester exams), don’t skip documentation. iit kgp has a system to handle this: if you miss an end-sem exam due to illness, and you get it certified by the campus hospital and a medical board, you can be granted a make-up exam with full grade credit erp.iitkgp.ac.in erp.iitkgp.ac.in . the process is: visit b.c. roy hospital immediately and get a medical certificate. the hospital/institute will convene a medical board for

immediately and get a medical certificate. the hospital/institute will convene a medical board for serious cases. write an application to the dean (undergraduate studies) through your hod, explaining you missed <em>xyz</em> exam due to illness (attach the medical docs) erp.iitkgp.ac.in erp.iitkgp.ac.in . this must be done as soon as possible, definitely before the supplementary exam cycle. if the board approves, you become eligible for a supplementary exam with full credit – basically a chance to give the exam later (usually in july) and get the actual grade you score (no grade drop penalty) erp.iitkgp.ac.in erp.iitkgp.ac.in . they treat it as if your first attempt was deferred for medical reasons. this policy also covers serious family emergencies – e.g. a death or calamity in the family during exams is given the same consideration as medical absence erp.iitkgp.ac.in . all such cases are decided individually by the dean and medical board erp.iitkgp.ac.in erp.iitkgp.ac.in . tip: it’s

decided individually by the dean and medical board erp.iitkgp.ac.in erp.iitkgp.ac.in . tip: it’s better to avoid writing an exam when very ill (you might underperform and get an f). if you have a documented medical issue, use the policy – inform the professor and institute, skip the exam, and petition for the make-up. a “medical f” can be turned into a proper grade later, whereas a poor exam taken while ill will stick. mental health breaks: what if the issue is depression, severe anxiety, or another mental health crisis? iit kharagpur in recent years has started to acknowledge mental health as a valid reason for breaks. a medical withdrawal can be taken for psychological reasons too, though you’d need certification from psychiatrists/psychologists (possibly through b.c. roy hospital which has psychologists on call). the process is the same – apply for withdrawal citing health reasons. many students struggle quietly with mental health, but it’s important to seek help (from the

many students struggle quietly with mental health, but it’s important to seek help (from the counselling center or an outside doctor) and get documentation if you need academic relief. is withdrawing for mental health better than slogging and failing? in many cases, yes. for instance, if you’re experiencing a breakdown and cannot study, withdrawing means you won’t have a semester full of f grades which wreck confidence and cgpa. one semester of zero grades (break) is easier to recover from than a semester of all fails. there may be some stigma or fear of “what will others say?” but in reality, your health comes first – you can bounce back academically when you’re well. iit rules don’t distinguish physical vs mental health in granting leave; what matters is having a legitimate condition and following procedure. medical leave vs. failing courses: students often ask, “should i drop the semester or try to push through and at least get some credits?” the answer depends on severity. if it’s

or try to push through and at least get some credits?” the answer depends on severity. if it’s early enough in the semester and you have a serious condition, a semester drop (withdrawal) is usually the wiser choice. it prevents cgpa damage and allows you to resume studies when you’re ready, with full effort. on the other hand, if it’s a minor illness or something manageable with a few weeks’ rest, you can use short medical leave and then catch up. keep in mind iit kgp’s attendance requirements – if you miss too many classes (typically >15% or specific departmental criteria) without proper excuse, you can be debarred (given an ‘x’ grade) from the exam. that results in an automatic backlog. so failing to officially sort out your medical absence can lead to an x/f grade which is avoidable. always communicate with instructors and the academic section in case of extended health issues. bottom line: don’t sacrifice your health out of fear of backlogs. the institute has mechanisms (medical

line: don’t sacrifice your health out of fear of backlogs. the institute has mechanisms (medical leave, make-up exams, withdrawals) to support students in genuine need. use them with proper documentation. several students who took a medical break or counseling break have returned to complete their degrees successfully – it’s not a black mark on your record to take care of yourself. it’s far better to take a sanctioned break and come back stronger than to silently suffer and underperform in every course. as one official put it, iit is willing to accommodate health issues case-by-case rather than have students continue in distress erp.iitkgp.ac.in . so, if you find yourself in such a predicament, reach out – to the dean’s office, the counselling center, or mentors – and explore the option of a health leave. your future self will thank you. make-up exams & special considerations beyond the standard supplementary exams and re-registering courses, iit kharagpur also deals with one-off

chunk 770 content...
the standard supplementary exams and re-registering courses, iit kharagpur also deals with one-off situations through special considerations. here we discuss make-up exams (outside the july supplementary) and how leniency or strictness can vary: make-up exams for mid-semesters/assignments: thus far we talked about end-semester make-ups. but what if you miss a mid-sem test or assignment due to illness or emergency? typically, professors handle this on a case-by-case basis. many professors allow a makeup midterm or an alternative assignment if you have a valid medical excuse (and you inform them promptly). there isn’t an institute-wide rule for mid-sems, but academic senate guidelines urge faculty to accommodate genuine cases (for example, by averaging other components or arranging a makeup). always communicate with the course instructor and provide medical certificates if you miss any evaluation. if a prof is unresponsive, you can escalate to the faculty advisor or hod for help. in

evaluation. if a prof is unresponsive, you can escalate to the faculty advisor or hod for help. in summary: minor exam absences can often be managed informally, whereas end-semester exam absence requires the formal route (dean’s approval) as discussed above. re-examination for absent students: as noted, if you were absent in the end-semester exam due to approved reasons, the institute grants a re-exam with full credit erp.iitkgp.ac.in erp.iitkgp.ac.in . this is essentially your make-up end-sem exam, usually held during the supplementary exam period (july) or possibly earlier for final-year students. importantly, for those approved on medical/family grounds, this make-up exam does not impose the “grade drop” penalty – you can earn whatever grade your performance merits erp.iitkgp.ac.in . this policy is a huge relief for someone who, say, gets dengue during finals – you won’t be punished grade-wise for circumstances out of your control. however, you must apply through the proper channel

chunk 772 content...
for circumstances out of your control. however, you must apply through the proper channel and deadline to avail this. it’s not automatic; some paperwork is needed (as described in the previous section). summer quarter vs. supplementary – which to choose? sometimes a failed course is also offered in summer quarter and you’re eligible for a supplementary exam. for example, suppose a core course you failed is being taught in summer; you could either (a) attend summer quarter classes and improve understanding, or (b) just self-study and take the one-shot supplementary exam. which is better? it depends on how comfortable you are with the material. summer quarter lets you learn with guidance (helpful if you fundamentally struggled with the subject) and the grading is like a normal course (no forced grade drop; you could potentially get a high grade) erp.iitkgp.ac.in erp.iitkgp.ac.in . the downside is the time commitment of 7 weeks and additional fees. the supplementary exam is quicker and

chunk 773 content...
is the time commitment of 7 weeks and additional fees. the supplementary exam is quicker and cheaper, but your grade is capped lower (unless you had an excused absence) erp.iitkgp.ac.in . many seniors advise: if the course defeat was due to lack of effort or one bad exam and you’re confident, go for the supplementary exam; but if it was due to conceptual weakness, consider doing the summer quarter to properly learn it. also, note you can’t do both – if a summer quarter is offered for a subject, the institute usually won’t allow a supplementary exam for that subject in parallel erp.iitkgp.ac.in . they expect you to take the summer course in that case. professor leniency vs. strictness: experiences vary widely. some professors are quite lenient with students facing hardships – e.g. giving makeup tests, extending project deadlines, or even waiving certain requirements if you have a prolonged illness (especially if they know the student well and trust their sincerity). there have been

illness (especially if they know the student well and trust their sincerity). there have been instances where a compassionate prof gave a student an “i” (incomplete) grade instead of an f when the student had a breakdown during finals, allowing them to complete the exam later. on the other hand, some professors adhere rigidly to rules: e.g. if you fall short on attendance by even 1%, you get debarred (grade ‘x’) with no questions asked, or they might refuse to shift an exam for a clashing medical appointment. overall, iit kgp’s system is rule-driven, so you shouldn’t expect individual leniency – but you can always request politely. if you have a genuine case (say, you missed a lab exam due to being in quarantine), most faculty will try to accommodate a solution if approached properly. departments also differ in culture: some departments are known to proactively help struggling students, while others believe in tough love. it’s a good idea to seek advice from seniors in your department

chunk 775 content...
while others believe in tough love. it’s a good idea to seek advice from seniors in your department – they often know which courses or instructors have some flexibility. for example, one reddit user suggested that if you fail in the ncc/nso (extra activity) requirement, you might try “begging the coordinator” to change your grade to pass if you have a medical reason reddit.com reddit.com . it’s not guaranteed, but it has worked in some cases for things like sports or workshop practice courses where the stakes are low. caution: never resort to dishonest means (like faking a medical certificate or editing an official document) – that can land you in serious disciplinary trouble. always use proper channels. harsh consequences: despite support systems, some students do face harsh outcomes. for instance, if you neglect coursework and accumulate many backlogs, you could be asked to repeat a year (register as an “year-back” student with a lighter load) – this is demoralizing, but it’s meant

chunk 776 content...
(register as an “year-back” student with a lighter load) – this is demoralizing, but it’s meant to give you a reset. in extreme disciplinary cases (cheating, etc.), one might even be de-registered from courses or suspended, which creates artificial backlogs (grade ‘x’ that must be re-done) erp.iitkgp.ac.in . there have been unfortunate cases where students didn’t seek help in time and ended up with multiple f’s, severely delaying graduation. the key is to avoid letting things snowball. if you fail one course, address it the next chance you get (via re-exam or retake) – don’t ignore it. if you feel you’re heading towards several f’s, talk to your faculty advisor or mentors early. the institute does monitor “academically weak” students: those with >2 backlogs or cgpa <6 are required to have monthly meetings with faculty advisors for counseling erp.iitkgp.ac.in . take those seriously – they’re not punishment, they’re to help you reflect and improve. on the flip side of harshness,

chunk 777 content...
– they’re not punishment, they’re to help you reflect and improve. on the flip side of harshness, remember that the senate has a “relaxation” clause: in truly exceptional cases, they can relax a rule for a student erp.iitkgp.ac.in . for example, if you are graduating and have one lab incomplete due to reasons beyond control, the senate may waive a requirement or extend a special chance. such mercy is rare but exists for “humanitarian” grounds. so never lose hope – if you have a unique problem, you can petition through dean/chairman for a one-time consideration. in summary, iit kharagpur strives to maintain academic rigor but not at the cost of humane considerations. make-up exams and special waivers exist to ensure that a setback or genuine crisis doesn’t permanently derail you. as a student, your responsibility is to promptly communicate and utilize these provisions. don’t be afraid to ask: whether it’s an extra tutorial from a prof, a deferred exam, or a leave of absence – you might

ask: whether it’s an extra tutorial from a prof, a deferred exam, or a leave of absence – you might be surprised at how understanding people can be when you are honest and earnest about your situation. administrative processes (how to navigate the system) dealing with backlogs or special exams can be confusing, especially when you’re already stressed. here’s a step-by-step guide to the key administrative processes and approvals you might need, and who to approach: registering for a backlog course: at the start of each semester, registration on erp will automatically flag that you have backlog subjects. the rule is you must register those first before any new electives erp.iitkgp.ac.in . the erp system usually allows you to add your backlog courses (they won’t count towards your credit limit for that term if they’re core requirements). if you have only one backlog, you can typically take it along with a normal full load erp.iitkgp.ac.in . if you have multiple, erp might restrict

chunk 779 content...
take it along with a normal full load erp.iitkgp.ac.in . if you have multiple, erp might restrict additional credits as discussed. in case erp doesn’t permit a reasonable load (say it blocks all electives because you’re weak category), you can do the following: talk to your faculty advisor (facad) – they often have to approve the registration for academically weak students manually erp.iitkgp.ac.in erp.iitkgp.ac.in . if needed, write a letter to the dean (ug studies) through your advisor and hod explaining why you need to take certain courses concurrently (perhaps to stay on track) reddit.com . students have successfully petitioned to be allowed an extra subject or two by demonstrating they have a plan to manage it reddit.com . the final approval for credit overload or exceptions lies with the dean (ug) in most cases erp.iitkgp.ac.in , based on department recommendation. but for routine backlog registration, your facad’s clearance in erp should suffice. applying for supplementary

backlog registration, your facad’s clearance in erp should suffice. applying for supplementary exams: after the spring semester, the academic section will issue a notification inviting applications for the july supplementary examination. if you’re eligible (see criteria in earlier sections), here’s what to do: fill the application on erp for each course you want to reattempt. (previously, one had to get the subject teacher or hod’s signature, but that requirement has been removed for simplicity erp.iitkgp.ac.in – now it’s mostly an online process). pay the exam fee per subject (the notification/erp will generate a payable fee, often a modest amount per course). submit before the deadline. there are no late applications, so keep an eye on your email/erp announcements after end-sems. the deadline is usually fairly soon after the end-sem results are out. once registered, the academic section prepares the schedule and communicates with departments to arrange the exams erp.iitkgp.ac.in .

prepares the schedule and communicates with departments to arrange the exams erp.iitkgp.ac.in . the timetable comes out (centrally for first year, otherwise by department) and you just show up for the exam(s). results of supplementary exams are usually declared before the next semester begins, so you know which backlogs you cleared. applying for summer quarter: if a summer quarter is offered, a notification will be out around may. the steps: register in person on the designated registration day for summer (usually at academic section or online if enabled). no late registration is allowed erp.iitkgp.ac.in . pay the summer quarter fee and mess advance (if staying in hostel during summer) erp.iitkgp.ac.in erp.iitkgp.ac.in . only students with all dues cleared can register erp.iitkgp.ac.in . attend classes diligently for 7 weeks and then take the exams. attendance and class performance matter here just like a normal semester erp.iitkgp.ac.in erp.iitkgp.ac.in . medical exam make-up

for guidance, academic office staff for procedural queries, and student representatives (swg, hall council) for peer advice. it can be daunting, but once you take the first step (filling that form or writing that email), you’re on your way to a solution. mental health & social stigma perhaps the toughest part of an academic setback is the emotional burden – guilt, shame, anxiety, or fear of being judged. campus culture at iits often glorifies success, so students with backlogs or leaves can feel like outliers. let’s address the mental health aspect and social perceptions: emotional impact of backlogs: failing a course or taking a leave can hit your self-esteem hard. it’s common to feel embarrassed or that you “let everyone down.” many students report experiencing anxiety walking into a class of juniors after a year-back, or avoiding friends because of a backlog. guilt and shame are natural reactions – especially in a competitive environment where it seems everyone else is doing fine

reactions – especially in a competitive environment where it seems everyone else is doing fine (truth is, they aren’t all fine). one iit alumnus who had 11 backlogs candidly shared: “suicidal thoughts were common for me. but the very next moment i thought about my family and spoke to seniors and friends around me. there is a life beyond academics, grades, and placement, trust me it’s good… i feel glad that i fought and had a life of my own. suicide is not an option.” linkedin.com . this powerful confession highlights two things: (1) you are far from alone in feeling despair – even top iitians have been there; (2) the way out is to reach out – talk to someone, gain perspective that academics isn’t everything, and realize you can recover. if you catch yourself in a spiral of negative thoughts, pause and consider that five years from now, a failed exam won’t define you, but how you responded to it might. seeking help (counseling and support): iit kharagpur has a counselling centre

and started proactive initiatives like group discussions on “accepting failures” and managing stress timesofindia.indiatimes.com . these group sessions and outreach events are meant to reduce stigma and let students know it’s okay to talk about these issues. many students have found solace in talking to the campus counselors or even wardens and professors who are empathetic. additionally, the student welfare group (swg) plays a role: they are a student-run team under the dean’s office that aims to help fellow students in distress. swg volunteers can lend an ear, connect you to resources, or just be a friendly senior to talk to wiki.metakgp.org wiki.metakgp.org . some halls (hostels) also have a hall welfare secretary – a student representative who looks out for hall-mates’ well-being. they often know how to get institute support if someone is struggling. bottom line: there are people and services ready to help, but you must take the step to reach out. dealing with social stigma: the

services ready to help, but you must take the step to reach out. dealing with social stigma: the fear “what will others think?” often looms large. it’s true that a stigma around backlogs/academic failure exists, but it’s diminishing as awareness grows. you might be surprised – friends are usually more understanding than you expect. once you open up, you may hear things like, “hey, i also flunked a test last sem,” or “i know seniors who took 6 years to finish, it’s okay.” the reality is, everyone at iit has faced failure at some scale; not everyone advertises it. surround yourself with supportive peers – those who judge you for one setback aren’t worth your energy. there are also peer groups informally – for example, students who are repeating a year often bond together and study as a group. one student who had to repeat semesters said initially he felt out of place, but then he connected with others in the same boat and they formed a study circle, which made him feel normal again. if

with others in the same boat and they formed a study circle, which made him feel normal again. if you’re coming back from a break or trying to integrate with a new batch, give it time. join some club or activity with them, and you’ll soon be “one of them” rather than “that guy with backlogs.” also, be upfront with your close friends about your situation – hiding it fuels shame, while being open often reduces the awkwardness. remember, your worth is not your gpa. as clichéd as it sounds, the institute’s very move to have group discussions on accepting failure timesofindia.indiatimes.com shows that failures are part of the journey, not something to be hidden in disgrace. faculty attitude: a concern for many struggling students is how professors will treat them. in most cases, faculty are professional and treat all students in class equally regardless of past records. if you approach a professor for help (say, you are repeating their course and want guidance), many will appreciate the

for help (say, you are repeating their course and want guidance), many will appreciate the initiative and give advice on how to pass this time. there might be a few insensitive comments from some (“you people who repeat never study” etc.), but those are exceptions and often said out of frustration, not malice. generally, if you show a professor that you want to improve, they’ll respond positively. also, institute policies ensure you’re not singled out publicly – e.g., grades and backlogs are private data, so no professor is going to announce “these x students failed last time” or such. any mentorship meetings for weak students are confidential and meant to help, not shame erp.iitkgp.ac.in . in recent times, there’s growing awareness among faculty about mental health – you can even directly tell an instructor if you had a rough time due to depression; many will be understanding and perhaps connect you to help. the academic culture is slowly but surely becoming more empathetic. coping

connect you to help. the academic culture is slowly but surely becoming more empathetic. coping strategies: students who overcame academic setbacks often share these tips for mental resilience: perspective: remind yourself why you are here. one bad semester doesn’t cancel the fact that you cleared jee and have many talents. zoom out: a 40-year career will not be derailed by a 6-month hiccup. avoid isolation: the worst thing to do is hide in your room. force yourself to socialize at least a bit – have dinner with friends, play a sport, attend a club meeting. positive social interactions rebuild confidence and keep your mind from dark places. small wins: set small achievable goals – like “this week i’ll finish chapter 1” – and celebrate when you do. regaining a sense of accomplishment, even in tiny steps, combats the feeling of failure. peer mentors: if you can, talk to a senior or alum who had a similar challenge. hearing their story of recovery can be incredibly motivating. (for

who had a similar challenge. hearing their story of recovery can be incredibly motivating. (for example, many alumni openly discuss how they bounced back; see next section for such stories). healthy routine: it sounds unrelated, but regular sleep, exercise, and decent food greatly affect your mood and concentration. when we’re upset, these basics slip, and then everything feels worse. try to maintain a routine – it provides stability when academics are chaotic. campus resources: use the counselling center. use swg events like stress-management workshops. these are free and right there on campus. even things like meditation or yoga sessions at the gymkhana can help clear your mind. in conclusion, don’t let stigma or shame stop you from seeking help. iit kharagpur is working to create a more supportive environment (for instance, appointing associate deans specifically for student well-being timesofindia.indiatimes.com timesofindia.indiatimes.com ). students themselves are becoming more

timesofindia.indiatimes.com timesofindia.indiatimes.com ). students themselves are becoming more open about struggles. as one student welfare slogan puts it, “it’s okay to not be okay.” what’s not okay is suffering in silence thinking you’re the only one. you are never alone – many have had backlogs, taken leaves, fought depression – and many have emerged stronger. the institute and your peers ultimately want you to succeed and be healthy. so cast aside the unnecessary shame, and focus on recovery and growth. one day you might be the alum telling juniors how you made it through tough times. alumni recovery stories success after setbacks is not just a comforting idea – it’s a reality for many iit kharagpur alumni. let’s look at a few inspiring case studies and lessons from those who turned backlogs or breakdowns into comeback stories: the multi-backlog turnaround: an iit kharagpur student, sushovan, revealed that he had around 7 backlogs by the end of 4th year sushovanhaldar.medium.com

linkedin.com . importantly, he emphasizes reaching out and that “there is a life beyond academics, grades, and placement, and trust me it’s good.” linkedin.com . this is a crucial perspective: your iit degree is important, yes, but your life is much bigger than that. many alumni with poor grades still find their path – some by improving academically later (e.g., writing gate and doing well in grad school), others by leveraging skills in other areas. for instance, someone with backlogs might have extra time to pursue coding projects or arts, which later becomes their career strength. from zero to gate topper: in a youtube interview (“from backlogs to air 2 in gate”), an iit kgp graduate explained how he had several backlogs in college which derailed his campus placement chances. instead of giving up, he focused on preparing for gate (the graduate aptitude test in engineering) after graduation. the structured preparation and the lessons from past mistakes paid off – he cracked gate with

the reassurance from alumni and senior students who recovered cannot be overstated. it means if you hustle to clear your backlogs and improve your cgpa in the remaining time, you still have access to good opportunities – maybe campus jobs, maybe off-campus, maybe higher studies. companies often care more that you eventually overcame the issue rather than the fact that you had one. we even see companies explicitly not minding an old backlog if it’s no longer active reddit.com . regret vs resilience: a theme in many alumni stories is regret for not addressing problems sooner, but pride in the resilience that followed. they often advise: don’t wallow in regret. an alumnus wrote, “i would rather work with someone who has faced and overcome failure than someone who has been a success every time. the former anticipates adversity and knows ways around it – a great skill taught only by surviving being thrown under the bus.” linkedin.com . this comment (from a linkedin discussion) is telling –

stories: your story isn’t over because of a setback – in fact, it might be the beginning of a great comeback narrative. the common threads in these case studies are determination, willingness to seek help, and maintaining hope for the future. use these examples as proof that “it’s not the end unless you give up.” someday you might inspire future students with your journey of resilience. summary of key rules and recovery tips to consolidate the insights, here’s a quick-reference table that pairs important institute rules with practical advice for recovery (academic and emotional): scenario / issue institute policy / rule recovery advice / notes failing a course (backlog) must re-register the course in a later semester or summer quarter. supplementary end-sem exam available only for 1st & final year f grades erp.iitkgp.ac.in . all backlogs must be cleared to graduate (8-year limit for b.tech) erp.iitkgp.ac.in erp.iitkgp.ac.in . don’t panic – analyze why you failed. if conceptual

it happened. 2. inform and consult: 🔹 if you’re sick or had an emergency: immediately inform your professors and if needed the academic section/dean’s office. a quick email describing your situation (with maybe a hospital note attached) helps create a record of your genuine reason. 🔹 visit b.c. roy hospital (if medical) to get proper documentation. 🔹 talk to your faculty advisor: they are your go-to person for academic difficulties. be honest about what happened; ask for advice on options (they might clarify if you can get a make-up exam, etc.). 🔹 inform family or a trusted friend: don’t keep it all in. telling someone you trust can provide emotional relief and practical support (for instance, a parent can help arrange documents or a friend can bring you class notes). 3. know your deadlines: 🔹 supplementary exam application: check the academic calendar or notices for the last date to apply for july supplementary exams erp.iitkgp.ac.in . mark it and apply on erp well before the cutoff.

chunk 815 content...
for july supplementary exams erp.iitkgp.ac.in . mark it and apply on erp well before the cutoff. 🔹 summer quarter registration: if you plan to attend, note the registration day (usually mid-may) erp.iitkgp.ac.in . no late registration is allowed, so be there. 🔹 dean’s petition for make-up exam: if you missed an end-sem, usually you must apply within a few days after the exam period. get that letter in as soon as possible with all attachments. 🔹 semester withdrawal: must apply within first 2 weeks of the semester (if you realize you cannot continue that term) erp.iitkgp.ac.in . keep this in mind at semester start if your health is in doubt. 4. file the paperwork: 🔹 fill required forms on erp: e.g., supplementary exam form, or backlog course registration (erp will list your backlog subjects – select them during registration). 🔹 write applications as needed: a letter to dean (ug) through hod for special cases (overloads, make-up exams) – use polite formal language, state facts and

hod for special cases (overloads, make-up exams) – use polite formal language, state facts and requests clearly. if unsure, ask a senior or hall/club senior for a sample format (as one student did via hall gsec) reddit.com . 🔹 attach supporting documents: medical certificates, death certificates (for family emergencies), etc. ensure they are signed/stamped by appropriate authority (for medical, preferably the campus hospital). 🔹 keep copies: always keep a photocopy or digital copy of any application and document you submit. it helps if anything gets misplaced or if you need to refer later. 5. engage in classes/prep: 🔹 if repeating a course: attend all classes and labs the second time around. you’ll find it easier since it’s not entirely new – use that to your advantage. introduce yourself to the new professor if it’s a different one, and let them know you’re repeating and determined to do well (it sets a positive impression). 🔹 gather study materials: get past question papers, notes

do well (it sets a positive impression). 🔹 gather study materials: get past question papers, notes from toppers, tutorial solutions – whatever resources to address where you went wrong. if you missed fundamentals, consider starting from a good textbook or nptel video from scratch. 🔹 time management: balance backlog courses and current courses. make a weekly schedule allocating extra time for backlog subjects (since you must clear them this time). utilize evenings or weekends for backlog review so that you don’t neglect new courses either. 6. utilize support systems: 🔹 tutoring and doubt sessions: if swg or your department runs special coaching (some profs hold extra classes for weak students or swg does doubt clearing for tough courses), attend those wiki.metakgp.org wiki.metakgp.org . it can be a safe space to ask basic questions you hesitated to ask in class. 🔹 counseling centre: book an appointment if you feel overwhelmed, depressed, or anxious to the point it affects daily

book an appointment if you feel overwhelmed, depressed, or anxious to the point it affects daily functioning. you can do this via email/phone provided on the counselling center site. it’s confidential and free. sometimes just a couple of sessions can help you regain focus. 🔹 mentors and seniors: reach out to a senior in your dept who had a backlog or any senior you’re comfortable with. they might have valuable tips or at least share their story, which can motivate you. 🔹 friends: don’t cut off your friends. let a few close ones know you’re struggling so they can check on you, share notes, or drag you to a refreshing tea break when you need it. 7. health and routine: 🔹 sleep & diet: it’s tempting to sacrifice sleep to study more, but try to maintain a regular sleep schedule. a well-rested mind learns and retains far better – quality over quantity. eat your meals; an empty stomach can worsen anxiety. 🔹 exercise: even a 20-minute walk or a sport thrice a week can dramatically improve

worsen anxiety. 🔹 exercise: even a 20-minute walk or a sport thrice a week can dramatically improve mood and brain function. kgp campus is great for jogging or cycling – use that to clear your head. 🔹 mindfulness/relaxation: during high stress, techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga can help maintain calm. there are student yoga classes and also materials from counselling centre on mindfulness – give it a try, it’s scientifically proven to reduce academic stress. 8. monitor progress: 🔹 track your grades: in the makeup exams or repeat courses, monitor how you’re doing. if mid-sem results are poor, seek feedback: go to the instructor and ask how to improve for end-sem. 🔹 adjust strategy if needed: if you tried self-study and it’s not clicking, maybe join a group study or get a tutor. if you find you’re still overloading yourself, talk to your facad about possibly dropping an elective to focus on core backlogs – sometimes less is more. 🔹 celebrate improvements: did you pass

educational institution, places a high priority on the health and wellness of its diverse campus community, which encompasses faculty, employees, and students. to meet these varied healthcare needs, the institute manages and is affiliated with two principal healthcare facilities: the long-established b.c. roy technology hospital (bcrth), situated within the campus, and the more recently developed, off-campus dr. syama prasad mookerjee superspeciality hospital (spmsh).this dual healthcare system reflects a deliberate strategy for healthcare provision. bcrth functions as the immediate and accessible primary care center, catering to daily medical needs and emergencies. conversely, spmsh is envisioned to offer advanced, specialized medical services and research capabilities. this two-tiered approach aims to address both routine and complex medical requirements of the campus community and the broader region. the healthcare landscape at iit kharagpur has recently undergone administrative

the broader region. the healthcare landscape at iit kharagpur has recently undergone administrative considerations and subsequent community responses, particularly concerning a proposed shift of services from bcrth to spmsh. understanding these dynamics is essential for anyone seeking medical services from these institutions.3. b.c. roy technology hospital (bcrth)location and primary rolethe b.c. roy technology hospital (bcrth) is strategically located centrally within the iit kharagpur campus, specifically "on scholars avenue opposite swimming pool".1 this positioning underscores its fundamental role as the "primary health care centre for all the students, staff members and faculty members of iit kharagpur".1 the hospital is directly owned and managed by iit kharagpur, demonstrating the institute's commitment to providing "quality healthcare services" through a comprehensive range of "curative, preventive and health promotion services" to its community.2services offered and

services, 'except a skeleton facility', would by december 23 be shifted to the new facility, syama prasad mookerjee superspeciality hospital (spmsh) at balarampur, 4km away".4 the "skeleton facility" at bcrth was intended to retain "only sample collection, pharmacy services and emergency primary care by nursing assistants – as well as the mortuary".4this proposed relocation, however, generated "widespread criticism" and "outcry" from various segments of the iit kharagpur community, including students, teachers, staff, and alumni.4 concerns primarily revolved around "transportation, accessibility and safety" due to the increased distance to spmsh.4 the intensity of these protests highlights the critical value placed on the on-campus bcrth. its central location and 24x7 operation are seen as indispensable for rapid response to common illnesses, minor injuries, and initial stabilization during emergencies for the residential campus community. the community's strong preference for

during emergencies for the residential campus community. the community's strong preference for proximity and convenience for primary care, even over the potential benefits of a larger, off-campus super-specialty hospital for daily needs, became evident.following this strong opposition and a hospital management committee meeting, the iit-kharagpur administration has "kept the relocation of staff and infrastructure from bcrth to spmsh on hold".5 a reliable source confirmed that "bcrth will continue to operate as it always has until further notice".5 this means that all services, including opd and ipd, remain fully functional at the on-campus bcrth. while the relocation is currently on hold, it is worth noting that the institute had previously planned a "campus conveyance service of three-wheelers (or 'totos') for travel between the hospitals" with expenses borne by the institute, had the shift proceeded.4 the decision to put the relocation on hold suggests that the administration is

after completing their 2nd or 3rd year of study.4 this flexibility extends to choosing dual degrees within their parent department or pursuing interdisciplinary dual degree programmes (iddp) offered by various schools and centers across the institute.4 for instance, a student pursuing a b.s. in economics could potentially opt for an m.tech. in artificial intelligence and machine learning, or a b.tech. (hons.) in civil engineering could pursue an m.tech. in financial engineering.4 this allows students to make more informed choices about their advanced specialization after gaining foundational knowledge and exploring their interests during their initial semesters.recent academic reforms and their impactin alignment with the national education policy (nep 2020), iit kharagpur has implemented several noteworthy reforms from the academic year 2024-25, reshaping the undergraduate academic experience.4one of the most significant changes is the abolition of the first-year branch change option

chunk 860 content...
of the most significant changes is the abolition of the first-year branch change option for undergraduate students admitted through jee (advanced).4 this reform was introduced to mitigate the considerable stress many students experienced while striving for exceptionally high grades in their first year solely to secure a branch change.4 previously, students could apply for a branch change after their second semester, provided they completed all prescribed credits in their first attempt with a cumulative grade point average (cgpa) of no less than 8.5.11 this policy change, coupled with the introduction of "double major" options and the delayed selection for dual-degree programs, indicates a deliberate institutional strategy. instead of forcing a high-stakes, early-career decision, students are now encouraged to explore their academic interests more broadly and make more informed choices later in their academic journey, while still having avenues to gain multidisciplinary expertise. this

chunk 861 content...
in their academic journey, while still having avenues to gain multidisciplinary expertise. this aims to foster a less competitive and more exploratory academic environment in the initial years, potentially improving student well-being and leading to academic and career paths that are more aligned with individual aptitude and passion.to compensate for the removal of the early branch change, the institute has introduced enhanced flexibility through other avenues. undergraduate students now have the option to simultaneously earn a "double major" alongside their b.tech (hons.) or b.s. (hons.) degree.4 this allows students to register for a double major in any discipline after their first year, such as a b.tech (hons.) in mechanical engineering with a double major in economics.4 this provides a structured pathway for students to gain in-depth knowledge in a secondary field of study.furthermore, the institute offers a semester away program (sap), enabling undergraduate students to spend one

chunk 862 content...
the institute offers a semester away program (sap), enabling undergraduate students to spend one semester at another reputable national or international institute, industry, or research laboratory, earning full academic credits.4 this program can be combined with the mandatory 8-week summer internship, allowing for an extended 8-month immersive experience in a different academic or professional setting.4students can also pursue a "minor" or a "micro-specialization" in various disciplines of their interest.4 a minor typically entails completing 18-24 credits, while a micro-specialization involves 10-14 credits, offering structured pathways for focused learning in allied or interdisciplinary areas.11a forward-looking curricular update is the new mandate for all students to study at least one ai/ml elective.4 this critical requirement is a direct response to the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning and their immense potential for national development.4 this

intelligence and machine learning and their immense potential for national development.4 this proactive approach ensures that all iit kharagpur b.tech graduates, irrespective of their core engineering discipline, will acquire a foundational understanding of ai/ml. this equips them with essential skills for an increasingly ai-driven global landscape, thereby enhancing their employability and adaptability. this strategic integration positions the institute at the forefront of preparing its graduates for future technological demands.3. core academic curriculum: a departmental breakdowncommon first-year curriculum for b.tech programsthe initial two semesters, constituting the first academic year, of most b.tech programs at iit kharagpur follow a common curriculum.1 this foundational year is designed to impart core science and engineering principles that are considered essential for all disciplines, providing a broad academic base before students delve into their specialized fields. the

a definitive academic calendar, issued at the beginning of each academic year, outlines the schedule for all academic activities, including registration periods, examination dates, and breaks.1semester registration guidelines and proceduresfor students beyond their first semester, registration for courses is contingent upon clearing all outstanding institute and hall dues from previous semesters and paying all required fees for the current semester. students must also not be debarred from registration due to disciplinary or other academic grounds.11 the registration process involves selecting subjects for the current semester according to the prescribed curriculum, with a mandatory prioritization of any backlog subjects. students must adhere to specified credit limits, typically a maximum of 28 credits per semester for normal students.52 for academically weak students, defined as those with a cgpa below 6.0 or more than two backlogs, registration options are restricted and require

chunk 887 content...
with a cgpa below 6.0 or more than two backlogs, registration options are restricted and require mandatory oversight and approval from their faculty advisor.11 minor changes to subject registration are generally permitted within one week from the official registration day, provided there is concurrence from the faculty advisor.11backlog procedures and supplementary examinationsstudents who receive an 'f' (fail) grade in one or more subjects during the autumn and/or spring semesters are provided an additional opportunity to clear these deficiencies through supplementary examinations.11 these examinations are centrally organized by the academic section and are typically conducted in july, before the commencement of the next academic session.11eligibility for supplementary examinations generally requires that a student must have appeared in the last end-semester examination for that subject and obtained an 'f' grade.11 however, exceptions are made for students who were absent from the

chunk 888 content...
and obtained an 'f' grade.11 however, exceptions are made for students who were absent from the end-semester examination due to certified medical reasons (verified by b.c. roy technology hospital) or a family calamity. in such cases, if the student passes the supplementary examination, they may be granted full credit for the course, without the usual grade penalty.11a crucial aspect of supplementary examinations is the grade conversion rule. unless a student is granted full credit due to exceptional circumstances (e.g., certified medical absence), passing a supplementary examination results in a grade that is one level lower than the actual grade scored in the supplementary exam itself. for instance, if a student scores marks equivalent to a 'b' grade in a supplementary exam, their final recorded grade for that subject will be a 'c'. the 'p' (pass) grade, however, remains unaltered.table 4: supplementary examination grade conversionoriginal gradeactual grade scored in supplementary

than relying solely on re-examination opportunities. students are thus encouraged to prioritize clearing subjects in the regular semester to avoid potential grade penalties and limited re-examination opportunities.summer quarter class registration and purposean additional academic term, known as the summer quarter, spans seven weeks and is conducted during the summer vacation.1 its primary purpose is to offer supplementary training to first-year students who have not cleared specific theory subjects during the regular autumn and/or spring semesters.11 this mechanism is distinct from the various summer internship programs, such as those offered by the ieee computer society, which focus on hands-on industry experience rather than academic remediation.53 registration for the summer quarter typically begins around early may, aligning with the release of spring semester results.54attendance requirements and debarment policiesattendance in all academic activities, including lectures,

chunk 891 content...
requirements and debarment policiesattendance in all academic activities, including lectures, tutorials, laboratories, and workshops, is compulsory at iit kharagpur.11 failure to maintain satisfactory attendance, typically defined as below 80%, can lead to debarment from appearing in an examination, resulting in an 'x' grade for that subject.11 furthermore, a student can be de-registered from a subject by the concerned teacher due to consistently poor attendance. such de-registration is generally a one-time decision and is not revocable, except under genuine medical grounds.11change of branch and interdisciplinary program optionsa significant academic reform implemented from the academic year 2024-25 is the abolition of the first-year branch change option for undergraduate students admitted through jee (advanced).4 this is a crucial policy shift from previous years, where students could apply for a branch change after their second semester based on high academic performance (cgpa not

chunk 892 content...
apply for a branch change after their second semester based on high academic performance (cgpa not lower than 8.5) and inter se merit.11the removal of this option aims to reduce the intense academic pressure and stress that many first-year students previously experienced while striving for exceptionally high grades solely for the purpose of changing their engineering discipline.4 student feedback often indicated that many freshers were preoccupied with branch change, sometimes to the detriment of their overall first-year experience and genuine academic exploration.55 this policy change, coupled with the introduction of "double major" options and the delayed selection for dual-degree programs, indicates a deliberate institutional strategy. instead of forcing a high-stakes, early-career decision, students are now encouraged to explore their academic interests more broadly and make more informed choices later in their academic journey, while still having avenues to gain multidisciplinary

chunk 893 content...
choices later in their academic journey, while still having avenues to gain multidisciplinary expertise. this aims to foster a less competitive and more exploratory academic environment in the initial years, potentially improving student well-being and leading to academic and career paths that are more aligned with individual aptitude and passion.in place of early branch change, the institute now offers substantial flexibility through other avenues. students can pursue a "double major" alongside their primary b.tech (hons.) or b.s. (hons.) degree, allowing for in-depth study in a secondary discipline.4 additionally, students can opt for dual degree programs (b.tech + m.tech) after their 2nd or 3rd year, either within their parent department or through interdisciplinary dual degree programmes (iddp).4 further opportunities for specialization and interdisciplinary learning are available through minor courses (18-24 credits) and micro-specializations (10-14 credits), which students can

chunk 894 content...
through minor courses (18-24 credits) and micro-specializations (10-14 credits), which students can pursue from their second year onwards, provided they meet specific academic performance criteria.4additional credits, minor, and micro-specialization opportunitiesiit kharagpur provides several avenues for students to broaden their academic scope beyond their core curriculum. from the third semester onwards, students demonstrating strong academic performance (a cumulative grade point average (cgpa) of 7.50 or above and no backlogs) can opt for additional subjects.11 the credits earned from these additional subjects, while recorded on the grade card, do not contribute to the calculation of the student's cgpa.11 the maximum limit for additional subjects is 33% of their major requirements.11departments also offer a minor in a discipline, which typically comprises six or more subjects (18-24 credits) from the curriculum.11 students aspiring for a minor can register at the beginning of their

chunk 895 content...
from the curriculum.11 students aspiring for a minor can register at the beginning of their 5th semester, provided they have a cgpa of 7.5 or above and no backlogs.11 to maintain active registration for a minor, students must consistently maintain a semester grade point average (sgpa) or cgpa of 8.0 or higher in subsequent semesters, without accumulating any backlogs.11since spring semester 2014-2015, micro-specializations have been offered, providing a more focused set of courses (3-4 subjects, 10-14 credits) in specific areas.11 students can register for a micro-specialization from any semester beyond the first year, requiring a minimum cgpa of 7.0 at the time of registration. subsequently, a cgpa or sgpa of 7.5 without backlogs must be maintained to continue the micro-specialization.11grading system and assessment of performanceiit kharagpur employs a 7-scale grading system to assess student performance. each letter grade corresponds to a specific grade point per credit, which is

chunk 897 content...
for subjects with a laboratory component, achieving a grade higher than 'f' necessitates scoring above the cut-off in both the theory and laboratory components.11 the institute generally aims for a normal grade distribution, with a small percentage of 'ex' grades (typically <= 10%) and 'f' grades (typically <= 5%).11support for academically weak studentsthe institute categorizes students as academically weak if their cumulative grade point average (cgpa) falls below 6.0 or if they have more than two backlogs or unregistered subjects, regardless of their cgpa.11 for these students, specific restrictions are placed on their subject registration options to help them focus on clearing deficiencies. a critical component of support for these students involves mandatory monthly meetings with their assigned faculty advisors.11 during these meetings, students can discuss their academic challenges, and faculty advisors provide guidance and suggest strategies for improvement. this proactive

if you take an elective in vlsi design, chances are the instructor is actively researching microelectronics. this means up-to-date content but also high expectations. overall, students benefit from faculty expertise, though a few faculty are known to be tough graders (more on that below). grading & evaluation: evaluation schemes vary – theory courses typically have midsem and endsem exams (each ~30-40%), with remaining weight in assignments, quizzes, and labs. lab courses (like electronics lab or communication lab) are heavily project/experiment based and often have vivas. one core lab, for example, analog electronics lab, might grade on weekly experiment reports (40%), a mid-term viva, and an end-term project/viva. grade patterns: e&ece core courses have historically been moderately graded with some skew depending on difficulty. a design-oriented lab tends to be lenient – e.g. in one power systems design (ee49004) lab (shared with ee) nearly half the class got top grades (13 ex, 31 a

systems design (ee49004) lab (shared with ee) nearly half the class got top grades (13 ex, 31 a out of ~79) and zero failed, indicating grade inflation/easy grading in such labs wiki.metakgp.org . on the other hand, tough theory courses like em theory or advanced communications might see very few ex grades and a bunch of c/d. in one semester of an ece elective derivatives (hs elective) that some ece students took for breadth, only 2 ex were awarded out of 38 students, with a significant tail of d/p grades wiki.metakgp.org – implying a hard grading or diverse student performance. curve vs absolute: most courses use relative grading. however, a few foundational courses have moved to absolute grading recently to enforce standards. (there was an institute-wide shift around 2018 for some first-year courses – more under physics/math below – but in department cores, relative grading is common, curving to a preset average.) grade deflation cases: a known case is if a professor deliberately

curving to a preset average.) grade deflation cases: a known case is if a professor deliberately fits a normal curve – e.g. in a core computer org course (taught by a math dept prof to ece/cse), only 2-3 got ex and most got b/c by design wiki.metakgp.org . in e&ece, some students whisper that certain analog electronics courses historically gave very few as, but official data is scant. grade inflation: conversely, elective courses that are interdisciplinary or taken by smaller groups (like some hss or management electives ece students opt for) often have higher average grades (easy a for those who attend and submit work). overall, ece core courses are not grade-trap nightmares – a student putting solid effort can secure at least a b in most, and many score a. it’s the outliers (skipping classes or weak basics) who risk low grades. difficulty & workload: perceived difficulty: e&ece is often perceived as one of the tougher branches at iitkgp. this is partly due to the heavy maths and

often perceived as one of the tougher branches at iitkgp. this is partly due to the heavy maths and physics underpinning (e.g. signals, electromagnetics) – in contrast to cse, which some find more intuitive after learning to code. as an education site notes, ece is perceived to require a solid grasp of fundamentals and thus can feel more difficult than cse collegedekho.com . within e&ece, students consider electromagnetic theory, signals & systems, and analog circuits as the “hard trio.” em theory, in particular, demands vector calculus and abstract thinking (maxwell’s laws) – many struggle initially. one student recollection from the 60s highlights that even back then em was challenging, but a passionate teacher made a huge difference studentsalumnicell-iitkgp.medium.com . signals and systems is another challenging core – it introduces fourier/laplace transforms, convolution, etc., which are concept-heavy. however, once mastered, it makes later communications courses easier. circuit

are concept-heavy. however, once mastered, it makes later communications courses easier. circuit theory and electronics: courses like device electronics (transistors, diodes) and analog circuit design involve both conceptual understanding and circuit problem-solving. these are of medium difficulty – not as math-heavy as signals, but tricky in their own way (one must grasp device physics and practice design problems). workload & time commitment: e&ece students face steady workloads: problem sets in core theory courses (perhaps 6-8 hours/week of self-study per technical course), plus lab reports and projects. the lab courses can be time-consuming – e.g. debugging a microcontroller kit or rf circuit can eat hours in the lab. it’s common to spend afternoons in lab followed by evenings writing reports or preparing for vivas. during project-heavy courses (e.g. final year vlsi project or communication system design), teams might spend 10+ hours a week on design and simulation, especially

system design), teams might spend 10+ hours a week on design and simulation, especially near submission deadlines. overall, weekly academic effort might be ~40+ hours (including classes) in busier semesters. students rate some courses as “chill” or “heavy” based on workload: for example, digital signal processing might be considered moderate (assignments but mostly straightforward using matlab), whereas integrated electronics could be heavy due to complex assignments and tough exams. student feedback & survival tips: a recurring tip is attend the classes – ece concepts build up and missing classes makes it exponentially harder. as one senior quipped for a vibrations elective, “it is super hard if you don’t go to class” wiki.metakgp.org – this applies broadly in e&ece. professors often emphasize certain derivations or tricks in class that appear in exams. use class notes as gospel: many ece profs provide lecture slides or written notes. students say for some courses “everything in exam

chunk 929 content...
profs provide lecture slides or written notes. students say for some courses “everything in exam is from class notes only, only and only” wiki.metakgp.org – so mastering those notes can guarantee a good grade. in fact, some find that rote-learning the derivations/steps from notes can fetch marks even if full intuitive understanding isn’t there wiki.metakgp.org . while not the ideal learning method, it’s a survival strategy: “understanding is optional if you can memorize/solve similar stuff to whatever is done in class” wiki.metakgp.org . this somewhat tongue-in-cheek advice underscores that professors often repeat lecture examples in exams. practice problems: for circuit courses, practice past tutorial and exam problems. prior years’ papers (accessible via friends or the instiinfo repository) show patterns – e.g. certain filter design or transistor bias problems get repeated. group study: many e&ece students form study groups, especially for tough subjects – explaining concepts to

chunk 930 content...
many e&ece students form study groups, especially for tough subjects – explaining concepts to each other (like sampling theorem or antenna radiation patterns) helps retention. consult tas and seniors: tas often hold tutorial sessions; attending those can clear tough doubts. seniors who took the course previously can provide insight on likely exam questions or the focus areas of a particular prof. for example, if prof. x loves communication theory proofs, be sure to prepare those. time management: balance hardware-heavy courses with lighter ones. if you have both microprocessors lab and analog lab in one semester, that’s a lot of soldering and coding – consider taking a lighter elective alongside, or at least be prepared for intense lab weeks. don’t ignore the basics: courses like network theory and basic electronics are foundation – if you solidify those, later courses feel easier. students who ace fundamentals often find electives like wireless communications or signal processing

chunk 931 content...
who ace fundamentals often find electives like wireless communications or signal processing quite “chill” because they reuse prior concepts. difficulty highlights: e&ece’s hardest courses often cited are em theory and perhaps advanced electronics. medium difficulty: communication theory, control systems (control is shared with ee – mathematical but manageable). easiest (relatively): some breadth electives (e.g. an intro to economics or management course taken for breadth) are easier a’s and many ece students use those to bump gpa. within department, courses like electronic measurement & instrumentation or industrial electronics are often considered less intense. also, final year project can be a gpa saver if done earnestly (project grades are usually high). many ece students also take programming electives (from cse) which, interestingly, they often find easier than their core – for instance, an ece student might breeze through a machine learning elective (as it’s less math-heavy than

an ece student might breeze through a machine learning elective (as it’s less math-heavy than their comm theory!). so leveraging interdisciplinary choices can make the plan “smarter.” planning advice for e&ece: 1) build a strong foundation: ensure you grasp 2nd-year core topics (circuit theory, signals, devices) – they recur in later courses. if needed, use resources like nptel videos (e.g. iit kgp has professors’ lectures on nptel for digital circuits, microcontrollers, etc. infocobuild.com ). 2) choose electives wisely: if your goal is higher studies in core electronics, take electives like vlsi design, communication networks, dsp – but be ready for hard work. if your goal is a lighter load or software industry, consider cs or management electives for some slots (many recommend courses from the school of management which “offer practical knowledge and moderate grading” reddit.com ). 3) manage labs and theory mix: try not to overload on too many lab courses simultaneously. labs

). 3) manage labs and theory mix: try not to overload on too many lab courses simultaneously. labs require continuous effort; one strategy is to pair a lab-heavy semester with a couple of theoretical electives that don’t have weekly assignments. 4) take advantage of lab evaluations: in some labs, consistent attendance and completing all experiments can virtually guarantee at least an a. these can buffer your gpa. 5) seek help early: if you find yourself struggling (say, you didn’t understand fourier transforms in signals class), get help immediately – attend remedial classes or ask a senior. the concepts scaffold quickly, and falling behind can hurt (students noted that if you aren’t attentive at the start of real analysis, by midsem it’s hard to catch up wiki.metakgp.org – similarly in ece courses like signals, the first principles are crucial). 6) use project courses to explore: e&ece offers project courses and optional research project electives – doing these with a good professor

chunk 934 content...
offers project courses and optional research project electives – doing these with a good professor can both boost your gpa (often graded leniently if effort is shown) and yield hands-on skills. plus, a strong project can be a highlight in placements or ms applications. electrical engineering (ee) curriculum & courses: the electrical engineering curriculum at iit kgp is focused on power systems, electrical machines, control systems, and electronics. in the first two years, ee students share some courses with ece (like circuit theory ee21101 – signals and networks and basic electronics) wiki.metakgp.org , but then diverge into heavy electrical topics. key courses include electrical machines (covering motors, generators, transformers), power systems (generation, transmission, distribution), control systems engineering, power electronics, and measurements/instrumentation. for example, ee31009 – control systems engineering is a core third-year course on feedback control theory (transfer

chunk 935 content...
– control systems engineering is a core third-year course on feedback control theory (transfer functions, stability, pid controllers) wiki.metakgp.org . electrical machines courses (usually split into machines i and ii) dive into dc machines, ac machines, and operational theory – often accompanied by a machines lab. power electronics teaches conversion devices (thyristors, inverters, etc.). the ee curriculum also emphasizes laboratory experience: there are core labs for machines (with hands-on with motors/generators), power systems simulation, and control experiments. in later semesters, students choose department electives like high voltage engineering, renewable energy, or advanced control theory. the program can be customized via dual-degree specializations (e.g. b.tech ee + m.tech in power electronics or machine drives) erp.iitkgp.ac.in , which add specialized pg-level courses in the 4th and 5th year. interdisciplinary electives like robotics (shared with mechanical), or data

the 4th and 5th year. interdisciplinary electives like robotics (shared with mechanical), or data science basics, are also open to ee students for breadth. course details & pedagogy: ee courses are known for blending theory with applied math. example: ee21101 – signals & networks (depth core, 3-1-0) teaches circuit analysis techniques (kirchhoff’s laws, thevenin/norton, ac circuits, frequency response) and introductory signal theory. it lays the groundwork for understanding electrical circuits and is typically in second year (autumn) wiki.metakgp.org . another core, electrical machines, has a very practical flavor – professors often use detailed drawings of magnetic fields and machine parts on the board to impart the “physical concept” before equations studentsalumnicell-iitkgp.medium.com studentsalumnicell-iitkgp.medium.com . this approach helps students visualize how motors/generators work in real life, not just in equations. elective example: ee60021 – power transmission systems (a

work in real life, not just in equations. elective example: ee60021 – power transmission systems (a grad/ug elective) covers advanced power grid design and is offered in later semesters raw.githubusercontent.com . it likely builds on power systems core knowledge and might be an elective in the final year. many ee courses list prerequisites: e.g., one should take control systems before an elective on robotics control; or power systems i before an advanced smart grid elective. the type of course (core vs elective) is clearly defined by the curriculum structure – cores in first 3 years, electives mostly in final year. semester offering: control systems and power electronics are usually third year (autumn/spring respectively), while many power electives are in final year. labs often run concurrently with theory classes (e.g. a machines lab in the same semester as machines theory). faculty & teaching style: the ee department’s faculty includes experts in energy systems, control theory, and

chunk 938 content...
teaching style: the ee department’s faculty includes experts in energy systems, control theory, and electronics. some long-serving professors are famously good at teaching fundamentals – e.g. as an alum from the 1960s recalled, prof. keshavamurthy in electrical machines emphasized understanding physical functioning so well that diagrams he drew stayed in memory decades later studentsalumnicell-iitkgp.medium.com studentsalumnicell-iitkgp.medium.com . that tradition of concept-first teaching continues with many current profs. faculty designations range from assistant professors (often handling new electives like smart grids, who bring cutting-edge research into class) to professors who might have literally written the book on machines or control. student feedback on ee faculty is generally positive – they are described as thorough and demanding but fair. for instance, in control systems, a professor might drill the class on deriving equations step-by-step but also ensure everyone grasps

professor might drill the class on deriving equations step-by-step but also ensure everyone grasps the physical meaning of stability criteria. research alignment: faculty researching renewable energy might offer an elective on solar/wind energy integration; similarly, a faculty in control theory might stress modern control methods in the core class. teaching reputation: a few ee professors are known to be tough graders (with old-school rigor), but also mentors who inspire students. the medium article studentsalumnicell-iitkgp.medium.com studentsalumnicell-iitkgp.medium.com highlights professors who motivated students to love difficult subjects – e.g. making complex topics like electromagnetic compatibility approachable. on the other hand, some courses (like basic electrical engg taught to other branches) might be handled by younger faculty or lecturers, often with a more exam-oriented approach. overall, ee faculty strive to instill strong fundamentals (the motto often heard: “don’t

approach. overall, ee faculty strive to instill strong fundamentals (the motto often heard: “don’t just memorize the formula, understand the system”). grading & evaluation: scheme: like other departments, ee courses typically have midsem and endsem exams (~25–30% each) plus quizzes, assignments, and lab components. control systems, for example, might have 2 quizzes (10%), midsem 30%, endsem 40%, assignments 10% and attendance or viva 10%. lab evaluation: labs (e.g. electrical machines lab) usually are graded via experiment performance and viva. because safety is an issue in high-voltage labs, students are expected to be prepared; however, grading in labs is often lenient if you show up and complete work. indeed, design/project labs in ee often yield high averages – e.g., in the power apparatus design lab mentioned earlier, the grade distribution was skewed towards a/ex wiki.metakgp.org , indicating an easier grading scheme (maybe because it’s a 2-credit lab with project focus). theory

indicating an easier grading scheme (maybe because it’s a 2-credit lab with project focus). theory course grading: most ee theory courses use relative grading. historically, first-year basic ee (taken by non-ee majors) had relative grading where many scored high, but recently that and other common courses moved to absolute grading to counter “bunching” of marks erp.iitkgp.ac.in shiksha.com . within ee, however, relative grading is typical – meaning your performance relative to peers matters. grade distribution: a look at a sample ee course distribution (from power design lab above) shows: 13 ex, 31 a, 15 b, 11 c, 5 d, 4 p, 0 f wiki.metakgp.org – a decent number of top grades and few lows. for a tougher theory course, the distribution might compress: e.g., real analysis for math had 6 ex out of ~67 and only 1 p, 0 f wiki.metakgp.org (similar scale could be seen in tough ee courses: a small handful of ex, a lot of bs/cs). grade inflation/deflation: ee isn’t notorious for grade

chunk 942 content...
a small handful of ex, a lot of bs/cs). grade inflation/deflation: ee isn’t notorious for grade deflation. the department does not force a strict quota like “only 5% can get ex” – if a class performs well, many can get top grades. in fact, courses like measurements or instrumentation often see many as because exams are straightforward. that said, a concept-heavy exam (like control systems with tricky stability problems) can spread students out. fail rates in ee core courses are low; most students who put in effort pass. one cautionary tale is if a course is made absolute grading (e.g., first-year physics was, resulting in a spike in fails wiki.metakgp.org ) – but in ee core courses this is uncommon. summary: expect a reasonably fair curve. if you’re around the class median, that’s usually a b or c. to secure an a, you need to be in the upper quartile (solid understanding). since projects and labs can boost grades, leveraging those (doing well in project, attending labs diligently for

chunk 943 content...
and labs can boost grades, leveraging those (doing well in project, attending labs diligently for full marks) can tip you into a higher grade bracket even if exams were average. difficulty & workload: subjective toughness: ee is often considered tough because it spans both heavy theory and practical application. students rate it as high workload – there’s a saying that “ee at kgp kuch raat ka mazak nahin” (not a cakewalk) among campus memes. difficult subjects include: control systems (lots of laplace transforms and abstract feedback concepts – miss a minus sign, and you lose points), electrical machines (requires understanding of electromechanical physics and remembering a lot of construction details), and power electronics (blend of device physics and circuit design). many find control theory conceptually challenging yet intriguing; it’s rated medium-hard. electrical machines demands memorization (types of motor windings, etc.) and problem-solving for performance calculations –

chunk 944 content...
memorization (types of motor windings, etc.) and problem-solving for performance calculations – students often find machines exams lengthy and hard if concepts aren’t crystal clear. workload intensity: in peak semesters, an ee student might have 5 theory courses + 2 labs. each theory course can have weekly problem sets (especially in control or power courses you might solve many network equations or control problems). labs require pre-lab prep and post-lab reports. a rough estimate: 6-8 hours per week per theory course (including class time and self-study) and ~3-4 hours per lab outside scheduled hours. that can sum to ~40-50 hours/week of academic work. the time commitment is manageable with good time management, but procrastinating on assignments can cause pile-ups. notably, in design projects (like a mini-project in power electronics), crunch time near deadlines can push workloads much higher for a week or two. student feedback & tips: fundamentals first: students repeatedly

chunk 945 content...
much higher for a week or two. student feedback & tips: fundamentals first: students repeatedly emphasize understanding the basics – e.g. “explain the physical functioning before the equation.” professors themselves often test this in vivas (one famous anecdote: a prof asking a student to forget the equation and explain how the system works physically studentsalumnicell-iitkgp.medium.com ). so, when studying, focus on why something happens (e.g. why induction motor slips) not just the formula. practice numerical problems: ee exams combine conceptual questions and numerical problems. practicing previous years’ questions and tutorial problems is crucial. many courses have question banks or the instiinfo site with past papers wiki.metakgp.org . use them to test yourself under timed conditions. attend tutorials and ask questions: many ee courses have tutorial classes (the 3-1-0 format indicates one tutorial hour). don’t skip these – tas often solve representative problems. also, don’t be

one tutorial hour). don’t skip these – tas often solve representative problems. also, don’t be shy to ask “silly” questions – resolving small confusions (like the sign convention in kvl) can be the difference between an a and c on an exam. leverage open-book if offered: some courses (rare in ee core, but sometimes electives) allow open-book exams. if so, prepare a good formula/reference sheet and understand derivations (open-book doesn’t help if you don’t know which formula to apply). lab tips: before a lab session, review the theory. if it’s machines lab and you’ll be running a 3-phase induction motor test, know the expected outcomes and procedure – it impresses instructors and speeds up completion. also, maintain a neat lab notebook; some profs give brownie points for organized work which can bump you from b to a. time management: start assignments early. if a control assignment is given, begin working on it that week; these problems (like proving routh criterion scenarios) can’t be

chunk 947 content...
begin working on it that week; these problems (like proving routh criterion scenarios) can’t be crammed last minute. study group and divide-and-conquer: students often split chapters or problem sets among friends then teach each other – this is effective in wide-syllabus courses like power systems. use simulation tools: for control systems and power electronics, tools like matlab/simulink or pspice are used. get comfortable with them; sometimes a professor allows simulation results in a report for extra credit. stay healthy and get rest: the ee workload can tempt all-nighters, but alertness in class (especially morning classes) significantly improves understanding. being attentive in an 8am machines lecture can save 3 hours of self-study later. relative difficulty ranking: among ee core subjects at kgp, electrical machines and em theory (if taken in ee curriculum, sometimes part of ece) are often considered toughest. control systems is tough but often a favorite for those inclined

chunk 948 content...
are often considered toughest. control systems is tough but often a favorite for those inclined towards math. power systems is moderate – lots to study, but mostly descriptive plus some calculations (many get good grades here by rote-learning fault analysis cases). power electronics has proven challenging for some due to device physics + circuits mix. easier courses include engineering drawing/graphics in first year and instrumentation – more straightforward content. also, the mandatory electrical technology course in first year (basic ee for all engineers) is usually easy for actual ee students (since it’s introductory). extracurricular load: many ee students prepare for coding job interviews or gate exam alongside studies – time management is crucial, but the curriculum itself provides a solid base for technical interviews (control, machines knowledge etc. often impress recruiters for core electrical roles). planning advice for ee: 1) course planning: try to complete critical cores

chunk 949 content...
core electrical roles). planning advice for ee: 1) course planning: try to complete critical cores by third year so that final year you can take electives of interest. if you have a choice, do control systems as soon as it’s offered – it helps in understanding other courses like power system stability. 2) choose a mix of electives: if research/grad school is a goal, take the advanced math-oriented electives (like adaptive control, or an extra course in power electronics). if you lean toward software/analytics, use some electives for programming or data science (ee folks often take a data structures course or machine learning elective – permissible as open electives). 3) dual degree option: if you’re in the dual program or considering it, note that starting 4th year the courses become pg-level (coded 60000+) and can be quite tough (but also rewarding). plan your 7th-8th semester workload knowing you’ll have a thesis project too. 4) utilize summers: the curriculum includes

chunk 950 content...
workload knowing you’ll have a thesis project too. 4) utilize summers: the curriculum includes training/internship – do an industry internship in power or an academic project in a lab. it lightens your final year because you’ll have practical context, and some internships even count as course credits (like summer training is a 2-credit mandatory component wiki.metakgp.org ). 5) peer learning: form study circles especially before exams – teaching someone else a concept is the best test of your own understanding. 6) consultation with professors: ee profs are generally approachable for academic advice. if unsure which elective to take, ask them – e.g. whether hvdc transmission or renewable energy systems would suit your interests/career goals. they’ll guide on content and difficulty. 7) maintain balance: don’t overload in one semester just to finish credits – it’s okay to spread electives out. for instance, if you find yourself with five hardcore courses in one term, see if you can move

out. for instance, if you find yourself with five hardcore courses in one term, see if you can move one elective to the next term or replace it with a lighter hss elective. some humanities courses (economics, psychology, etc.) are excellent choices – they require fewer hours than an additional heavy ee elective and can boost your gpa reddit.com reddit.com . many ee seniors recommend taking at least one management or humanities elective for a well-rounded (and less stressful) semester. mechanical engineering (me) curriculum & courses: mechanical engineering at iit kgp has a broad curriculum spanning mechanics of solids, fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, heat transfer, manufacturing, and design. in the first two years, me students build foundational knowledge in engineering mechanics (statics, dynamics), materials science, basic thermo, and manufacturing processes. for example, me10001 – mechanics (basic engineering mechanics) is taken in the first year erp.iitkgp.ac.in , covering

or interdisciplinary options like ocean engineering. the me department also offers dual degree programs (like manufacturing science and engineering as a separate stream, or verticals in quality engineering & design) erp.iitkgp.ac.in – these involve additional specialized courses like advanced manufacturing processes and often a research thesis. course details & learning approach: mechanical courses often involve theoretical derivations and problem-solving, as well as design project work. example: me30005 – heat transfer (core, 3 credits) covers conduction, convection, radiation and includes solving differential equations for temperature distributions, using correlations for convective heat transfer, etc. it’s math-heavy (lots of calculus and differential equations). example: me41603 – vibration and noise control (an elective in final year) requires design of machine elements as a prerequisite wiki.metakgp.org . it covers vibration theory, damping, absorbers, acoustics and noise

prerequisite wiki.metakgp.org . it covers vibration theory, damping, absorbers, acoustics and noise mitigation. teaching style in such courses blends theory with real-world examples – e.g. discussing how a car’s suspension is a vibration absorber. the prerequisite chain in me is important: one must take mechanics of solids before machine design, thermodynamics before heat transfer, fluid mechanics before advanced fluid machinery, etc. core vs elective: core me courses are usually completed by 6th semester (e.g. machine design, heat transfer are core), while electives fill 7th/8th sem. the program mandates a capstone project (project i and ii in 4th year) where students apply design/analysis skills on a practical problem. also, an 8-week summer training after third year is typical, though it may not carry credit formally in older curriculum (some new curricula include it as a 2-credit internship). faculty & instruction: mechanical engg faculty at kgp are known for their rigorous

others might be tough taskmasters who expect precise answers and have strict evaluation. for instance, feedback on prof. anirvan dasgupta (who teaches vibration control) is that he “teaches quite well and is patient with doubts” wiki.metakgp.org , and while his course is conceptually tough, he is fair. faculty often integrate practical insights – e.g. manufacturing professors might bring actual machined parts to class to illustrate machining processes. also, many me profs have authored textbooks or course materials (the slides/notes given are high quality in many subjects). faculty-student interaction: me faculty are approachable outside class for clarifying doubts; however, they expect students to attempt problems on their own first. research alignment is strong too – a professor doing research in composites may offer an elective on composite materials and bring cutting-edge examples. grading & evaluation: assessment style: me courses typically have a couple of major exams and

grading & evaluation: assessment style: me courses typically have a couple of major exams and regular homework or mini-quizzes. design courses often include project or design assignments (for instance, machine design might require designing a gearbox as a term project, counting toward 20-30% of the grade). labs (like workshop, or thermal lab) are graded on reports and viva – usually on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis, but counted for credit. grade patterns: mechanical engg courses historically follow a normal grade distribution in core classes. many core courses see a majority in b/c, some as and a few ex, and a small fraction d/p/f for those who underperform. for example, in one me elective’s past distribution (if we consider a similar pattern to real analysis which had 6 ex, 20 a, 16 b, etc. wiki.metakgp.org ), we infer me courses similarly don’t give an excessive number of ex grades. however, outright failures in me core are not common; most students clear the courses. grading

however, outright failures in me core are not common; most students clear the courses. grading style differences: some instructors may grade leniently – e.g. if an exam was very tough, they might award partial credits generously, raising the average. in courses like manufacturing processes, often the exams are easier and many get good grades (since a lot is theory/memory based). on the other hand, theory of machines/dynamics exams can be tricky – a moderate class average might result, keeping many grades around b/c. grade inflation examples: project-based electives can be grade boosters. if you take a cad/cam elective with a project, usually anyone who completes the project gets at least an a. another example: the vibration and noise control elective – student advice suggests if you attend and mug the class notes, you can score well wiki.metakgp.org wiki.metakgp.org , implying the exam is directly from lectures (so a diligent student could get a top grade). labs often inflate grades –

directly from lectures (so a diligent student could get a top grade). labs often inflate grades – e.g. workshop practice in first year is almost always an easy a for everyone (it’s 1-2 credits of making simple objects, and nearly all get full marks for participation). known deflations: if any, the design courses can be tough – professors sometimes intentionally challenge with open-ended problems. but they usually compensate with project scores. on balance, me grading is fair with slight leniency – it isn’t cutthroat. many mechanical students graduate with decent gpas, especially if they leveraged easier electives and labs. difficulty & workload: notorious tough topics: mechanical has its share of conceptually tough courses. fluid mechanics is often cited – deriving and applying bernoulli and navier-stokes can be hard; many find the fluid mechanics end-sem challenging due to complex calculus. heat transfer is also math-heavy (solving partial differential equations for conduction, for

chunk 960 content...
heat transfer is also math-heavy (solving partial differential equations for conduction, for example) – but at least it’s very systematic, so students who practice can do well. machine design is challenging because it’s an application of multiple fields (materials, mechanics) and requires open-ended thinking – you might be tasked with designing a machine element given constraints, which is more complex than a plug-n-chug problem. dynamics of machines (theory of machines) involves understanding vibrations, gyroscope effects, etc., which can be tricky. easier aspects: on the easier side, manufacturing process courses (learning about casting, welding, etc.) are more descriptive – students often find those exams straightforward (mostly memory-based theory). industrial engineering topics (like operations research, if taken) can also be relatively easier since they involve well-defined procedures (though or has math, it’s algorithmic and many students get high scores). workload: mechanical

chunk 961 content...
(though or has math, it’s algorithmic and many students get high scores). workload: mechanical engg demands steady effort. many courses have weekly assignments or tutorials. for instance, in solid mechanics or thermodynamics, you solve problem sets each week (taking ~4-5 hours). design courses may have fewer assignments but one big project that takes dozens of hours near deadline. labs like engineering drawing require time to complete sheets accurately – first year students sometimes spend hours at night perfecting drawing sheets. by third year, workload peaks: multiple heavy courses plus labs. students often spend afternoons in the heat engines lab or machine lab, then evenings doing calculations for lab reports. the notorious design project can eat into weekends near submission. however, mechanical engineers often manage by dividing work – e.g., in group projects, splitting calculations and report writing. time commitment: perhaps ~40 hours academic work/week on average, more during

and report writing. time commitment: perhaps ~40 hours academic work/week on average, more during project crunch times. it’s rigorous but not unmanageable if you don’t procrastinate. student feedback & tips: class attendance & notes: professors often emphasize things in class that are keys to solving exam problems. as one student put it for vibrations, everything in the exam came straight from class notes wiki.metakgp.org . so, maintaining a good notebook and annotating lecturer’s hints can be a game-changer. in courses like machine design, professors sometimes provide design charts/tables – know how to use them, and note any solved examples (exams often mirror them). practical understanding: try to connect theory to real life – e.g., when learning about refrigeration cycles in thermodynamics ii, think about how your dorm ac works. it aids memory and concept clarity. use reference books smartly: mechanical has many classic textbooks (e.g. shigley’s for design, sonntag for thermo).

chunk 963 content...
smartly: mechanical has many classic textbooks (e.g. shigley’s for design, sonntag for thermo). while profs give notes, reading the corresponding book chapter can clear doubts. some students refer to nptel or youtube videos for tough concepts (for instance, visualizing fluid flow or vibration modes). group study and resource sharing: it’s common to share solved examples and past solutions among classmates. the metakgp wiki and instiinfo have repositories for some mechanical courses wiki.metakgp.org wiki.metakgp.org – use them to practice. mugging vs understanding: there are parts you can score by rote (like remembering manufacturing process steps), but core mechanics needs understanding. if you’re struggling to grasp something (say, mohr’s circle in stress analysis), seek help from tas or seniors early. project tips: start design projects early. for example, if you need to design a machine element, begin with rough calculations and consult your professor if you’re unsure – they often

element, begin with rough calculations and consult your professor if you’re unsure – they often guide you (they want you to learn, not fail the project). also, splitting the project into parts (calculations, cad drawing, report) with team members saves time. time management during exams: mechanical exams can be lengthy (solving differential eqns or multiple design calculations). practice to improve speed. one strategy: solve simpler sub-questions first to secure marks, then attempt the harder ones. real student opinions: many mechanical students actually enjoy their subjects despite the effort. for instance, real analysis (a math dept course some take) was described as “one of the most interesting” courses wiki.metakgp.org – similarly, a mechanical student might say vibrations or robotics was tough but very rewarding if you’re interested. that enthusiasm helps – pick electives you find genuinely interesting, it’s easier to put in effort. survival tip shared for a me elective: “just

chunk 965 content...
genuinely interesting, it’s easier to put in effort. survival tip shared for a me elective: “just mug the class notes thoroughly. if you regularly understand or at least memorize what’s done in class, you’ll be fine. it’s extremely difficult to find external resources – but you won’t need them if you follow lectures.” wiki.metakgp.org wiki.metakgp.org this underscores the importance of sticking to what the professor emphasizes. difficulty ranking: hardest: fluid mechanics and heat transfer (due to heavy math), machine design (due to complexity and open-ended nature), theory of machines (conceptually tricky). medium: thermodynamics (fundamental but logical), mechanics of solids (lots of formulae but straightforward once understood), control (me students take basic control in some cases, less intensive than ee’s version). easiest: manufacturing processes, engineering drawing, and some management-type electives (industrial management, etc.). also, final year electives like automobile

chunk 966 content...
management-type electives (industrial management, etc.). also, final year electives like automobile engineering are often considered “chill” because they’re more qualitative (if you’re a car enthusiast, it’s fun and not too hard to score). however, ease varies by person – a student strong in math might find fluids easier and design harder, or vice versa. generally, mechanical engineering requires a balance of analytical and creative thinking, which is challenging but produces versatile engineers. planning advice for me: 1) solidify fundamentals early: first-year mechanics and second-year core courses form the base. don’t ignore them thinking you’ll mug before exam – continuous understanding is key. 2) manage your workshop/lab schedule: some labs (like workshop practice) can physically exhaust you. try not to schedule heavy brain-work right after a tiring lab – give yourself a break or a light subject study in those slots. 3) use summers for hands-on experience: if possible, do

chunk 967 content...
or a light subject study in those slots. 3) use summers for hands-on experience: if possible, do internships in manufacturing plants or research labs – it makes subjects like manufacturing, ic engines much clearer and can reflect in your grades (you’ll have practical answers to viva questions). 4) electives strategy: decide if you want to specialize or diversify. for core me jobs or higher studies, take technical electives (e.g. cfd, composite materials). if you want to lighten load or broaden horizon, consider one or two hss or management electives – e.g. hs30092 – demography or im60031 – marketing management are courses some me students take to earn an easy good grade and learn something different raw.githubusercontent.com raw.githubusercontent.com . 5) final year project: treat it seriously – it’s 8-10 credits usually (over two semesters) and an a here can buoy your gpa. choose a project topic that interests you (design/build something or research analysis); enthusiasm will make

chunk 968 content...
topic that interests you (design/build something or research analysis); enthusiasm will make the workload feel lighter. start early and work consistently on the project to avoid last-minute crunch. 6) peer network: stay connected with batchmates – share notes (especially if you have to miss a class for any reason, get notes immediately). forming study groups before exams helps split the syllabus and quiz each other. 7) health and schedule: mechanical tasks can be physically draining (long hours standing in lab, workshop, etc.). maintain a healthy routine – short breaks during long study sessions, proper sleep before exams (avoiding calculation mistakes from fatigue). many seniors advise juniors to not pull an all-nighter before a design exam – better to be fresh and recall formulas than exhausted. 8) seek mentor guidance: each student is assigned faculty advisors – you can also approach approachable professors informally. they can help if you’re struggling or considering higher

chunk 969 content...
approachable professors informally. they can help if you’re struggling or considering higher studies. for instance, if you’re interested in robotics, a professor might let you sit in an elective or guide you to online resources even if you can’t register for it yet. use these opportunities. mathematics, physics, and chemistry (basic sciences) curriculum role: mathematics, physics, and chemistry are taught both as service courses to engineers in the first year and as full-fledged programs for b.sc. (math and computing, physics, chemistry) and integrated m.sc. students. our focus is undergrad courses that most iitkgp students encounter. every engineering student takes at least two math courses, two physics courses, and one chemistry course in the first year erp.iitkgp.ac.in erp.iitkgp.ac.in . these foundational courses have a reputation of their own at iitkgp. mathematics courses course details: the common maths courses are ma11003 – advanced calculus and ma11004 – linear algebra,

details: the common maths courses are ma11003 – advanced calculus and ma11004 – linear algebra, numerical and complex analysis in first year erp.iitkgp.ac.in , followed by ma20205 – probability and statistics for some branches erp.iitkgp.ac.in . for math majors, there are higher-level courses like real analysis (ma31005), abstract algebra, differential equations, etc. example: ma10002 – mathematics ii (4 credits, spring of first year) covers linear algebra, vector calculus, and numerical methods wiki.metakgp.org wiki.metakgp.org . the syllabus is quite packed (matrices, eigenvalues, multiple integrals, vector calculus theorems, interpolation, root-finding algorithms all in one course). another, ma20104 – probability and statistics is taken typically in second year by many engineers, introducing probability theory and statistical methods. in advanced math stream: ma31005 – real analysis (core for math majors) rigorously defines real numbers, sequences, series, continuity,

chunk 971 content...
analysis (core for math majors) rigorously defines real numbers, sequences, series, continuity, differentiation and integration with epsilon-delta rigor wiki.metakgp.org wiki.metakgp.org . faculty & teaching: the math department faculty are pure and applied mathematicians. they teach large first-year classes as well as small honors classes. in first year, courses might be taught in multiple sections by different professors – some known to be very clear, others a bit fast. generally, concepts are taught rigorously with proofs (especially for math-major classes). student feedback indicates some professors supplement lectures with nptel video suggestions and reference books for tough topics wiki.metakgp.org (for instance, prof. jeetendra kumar’s nptel lectures were recommended for calculus wiki.metakgp.org ). the teaching quality is well-regarded; however, the pace is quick. many engineering students find first-year math a step up from jee math – not necessarily harder in content, but

chunk 972 content...
students find first-year math a step up from jee math – not necessarily harder in content, but broader in scope and requiring more proof-based understanding (particularly true for math-majors). grading & difficulty: math courses historically had relative grading, but around 2018 a significant change occurred for first-year core math: they moved to an absolute grading scheme (at least temporarily). in math ii, for example, an iitkgp source notes “absolute grading same as in erp” meaning a fixed cut-off system was used wiki.metakgp.org . this made math ii a bit harder to score since there was no curve safety net. even so, the distribution for math-ii (spring) in one year was: 227 ex, 231 a, 246 b, 219 c, 160 d, 191 p, 29 f wiki.metakgp.org across the whole first-year batch. that’s a wide distribution – a lot of high grades but also a notable number of low passes and 29 fails. the commentary says math-ii is “a bit more difficult than first semester” but consistent work yields good

chunk 973 content...
says math-ii is “a bit more difficult than first semester” but consistent work yields good results wiki.metakgp.org . indeed, many got ex/a, but because of absolute grading, those 29 fails happened (with relative grading maybe those might have been p grades instead). by contrast, prior to 2018, math courses were considered easier to score (since relative grading often bumped many into a range). math major courses: for those in 5-year integrated or 4-year bs maths, the grading is relative and often forgiving if the class is small. real analysis distribution shows only 1 p and 0 f out of ~67 wiki.metakgp.org – so almost everyone passed, and 6 got ex. that suggests while it’s tough conceptually, students inclined to math cope, and failures are rare in higher math courses. difficulty: first-year math is moderate difficulty for those with strong jee math background, but can be tough if you neglect it. the content volume is large (e.g. entire linear algebra and vector calc in one semester).

it. the content volume is large (e.g. entire linear algebra and vector calc in one semester). students say consistency is key: “if you are consistent with tutorials and classes then you can easily score good” wiki.metakgp.org , whereas not paying attention early can snowball into confusion later wiki.metakgp.org . topics like series of functions in real analysis ramp up in complexity; staying attentive from the start is vital wiki.metakgp.org . workload is mostly self-study and homework problems – expect weekly tutorial sheets. student tips: “attend tutorials, understand concepts, practice from standard texts (like bs grewal or jain & iyengar for calculus)” wiki.metakgp.org . in math-ii, students recommended solving all problems from certain reference books and past papers to do well wiki.metakgp.org . they also mentioned that attendance counts in teacher’s evaluation for some math courses wiki.metakgp.org , so going to class can directly or indirectly boost your grade. for math

chunk 975 content...
courses wiki.metakgp.org , so going to class can directly or indirectly boost your grade. for math majors: focus on proofs and logical structure – the courses are designed to make you think rigorously. one student wrote real analysis “offers a great platform for thinking…starting from fundamental questions like what actually is a real number” and praised how it answers things we took for granted wiki.metakgp.org . that intellectual payoff is high if you engage. difficulty-wise, math courses can be made “easy” grade-wise by staying on top of materials; otherwise they become “hard” quickly if you fall behind (since later topics build on earlier ones heavily). physics courses course details: the typical first-year physics courses at iitkgp are ph11001 – physics (often titled physics-i, 4 credits) and ph11003 – physics of waves (or a variant focusing on oscillations, optics, and modern physics, also 4 credits) erp.iitkgp.ac.in wiki.metakgp.org . physics-i usually covers mechanics and

physics, also 4 credits) erp.iitkgp.ac.in wiki.metakgp.org . physics-i usually covers mechanics and basic electromagnetism; physics of waves (physics-ii) covers oscillations, waves, optics, and an intro to quantum mechanics. for example, the physics (ph11001) course syllabus includes damped and forced oscillations, wave motion, electromagnetic waves, interference and diffraction, and an introduction to quantum (1d potentials, etc.) wiki.metakgp.org wiki.metakgp.org . the laboratory component is separate (ph19001/ph19003 – physics lab, 1 or 2 credits) where students perform experiments like newton’s rings, optical prism, photoelectric effect, etc. wiki.metakgp.org wiki.metakgp.org . beyond first year, physics majors delve into mathematical physics, quantum mechanics, solid state physics, etc. but focusing on the common courses: they are calculus-based and concept-heavy. faculty & teaching: physics faculty are researchers in areas like condensed matter, photonics, high energy physics,

chunk 977 content...
physics faculty are researchers in areas like condensed matter, photonics, high energy physics, etc. in first-year courses, typically a large class is split among 2-3 professors. the teaching approach blends conceptual discussion with mathematical derivations. historically, iit kgp physics was known to be very scoring with straightforward teaching – “physics was considered one of the subjects which could get you good grades if you are thorough with the slides and practiced problems” up to 2017 wiki.metakgp.org . professors provided slide decks (somnath bharadwaj’s book was followed for waves/optics) and formula-based questions dominated exams wiki.metakgp.org . however, around spring 2018, a major shift happened under a new teaching group: they changed to absolute grading and significantly raised the difficulty of exams wiki.metakgp.org . the result was dramatic – “the standard of the paper went very high… questions were abstract and conceptual… almost 121 students received f in

chunk 978 content...
the paper went very high… questions were abstract and conceptual… almost 121 students received f in spring semester compared to only 8 in the autumn semester” wiki.metakgp.org . this implies the faculty made physics more concept-oriented, less plug-and-chug. since then, physics exams demand deeper understanding (e.g. applying concepts from scratch rather than using memorized formulas). professors now stress fundamentals: they might not give full credit for just writing an equation; they expect you to explain physical reasoning in answers too. in summary, physics teaching went from relatively relaxed to quite demanding and thorough. grading & difficulty: as noted, physics switched to absolute grading and tougher papers in 2018. in absolute terms, typically a student needed ~35-40% for passing, ~90% for ex, etc. the effect was that failing became a real risk if one didn’t grasp the material. the grade distribution for the first tough physics offering: only 8 ex (in autumn with easier

chunk 979 content...
the grade distribution for the first tough physics offering: only 8 ex (in autumn with easier paper) vs 121 f in spring (with harder paper) out of maybe ~1200 students wiki.metakgp.org ! that is an anomaly in iits – failing 10% of the class in physics was unheard of before. so yes, physics earned a “tough” reputation. since then, the physics faculty likely moderated a bit, but it remains concept-heavy. if you compare, chemistry and math didn’t see that level of failure spike, indicating physics became the grade-deflation culprit of first year. for physics majors, advanced courses are smaller and graded relatively; they tend to be challenging but if you’re a physics enthusiast you manage. the consensus among undergrads is: first-year physics at kgp is no longer the easy-scoring subject it used to be. it demands time and understanding. student feedback & tips: students who went through the spring 2018 physics course gave the following tips (documented on metakgp): 1) be thorough with

the spring 2018 physics course gave the following tips (documented on metakgp): 1) be thorough with concepts so you can start from scratch. because the exam might not directly ask formula application, but rather test conceptual derivations or deep understanding wiki.metakgp.org . 2) don’t rely only on lecture slides, especially after 2018 – earlier, slides sufficed, but now one must read textbooks (like the one by somnath bharadwaj & sastry, or kleppner & kolenkow for mechanics) to truly grasp topics wiki.metakgp.org . 3) solve irodov-level problems for practice. indeed, students recommended solving i.e. irodov problems for oscillations and modern physics to handle tricky questions wiki.metakgp.org . 4) attend tutorials and note differences across sections: each section had different ta-set papers for class tests, some easy, some very hard wiki.metakgp.org . there’s an element of luck, but you can’t bank on an easy section – prepare for high difficulty. 5) lab prep: the physics lab is

you can’t bank on an easy section – prepare for high difficulty. 5) lab prep: the physics lab is relatively straightforward – just ensure you know the theory behind each experiment, as vivas are easy points if you can explain (e.g. how newton’s rings work, what is hall effect, etc.). physics lab usually isn’t a gpa killer; theory is where the battle is. for physics majors or enthusiasts: engage deeply – ask questions in class (professors welcome curiosity), join the physics and astronomy society which often helps first-years. if something like fresnel vs fraunhofer diffraction confuses you, seek clarification early; these topics stack up. another student note: prior to 2018, one could get an ex by just being thorough with slides and formulae wiki.metakgp.org , but now one must solve problems that require multi-step reasoning beyond slides. so adapt study strategy accordingly. chemistry courses course details: the standard first-year chemistry for engineers is cy11003 – chemistry (or

process demos wiki.metakgp.org . for chemistry majors, there are specialized courses later (organic chemistry, quantum chemistry, etc.), but focusing on the common course: it is less math-heavy than physics, more mix of conceptual and factual knowledge. faculty & teaching: the chemistry department faculty handle the first-year course usually in a coordinated manner (often one part taught by one professor, e.g. physical chem by one, organic by another). they provide structured slides/notes. students have found that a lot of first-year chemistry overlaps with jee syllabus, but taught in a more applied perspective wiki.metakgp.org . for instance, concepts from jee (like thermodynamics, equilibrium) appear, but professors may stress industrial or practical examples, and expect deeper understanding (e.g. deriving thermodynamic relations, not just using them). teaching quality is generally good – many students find chemistry lectures engaging if they liked chemistry in school. faculty often

– many students find chemistry lectures engaging if they liked chemistry in school. faculty often give slides as main material and specify that as the “complete syllabus” wiki.metakgp.org – indeed, one student noted “the basic and complete syllabus is defined by the slides provided by the profs and is your main study material” wiki.metakgp.org . they also incorporate some new topics not in jee (e.g. bio-inorganic chemistry, some spectroscopy). the approach is less mathematically rigorous than physics; it involves understanding concepts and some memorization (like properties of materials, organic mechanisms). grading & difficulty: historically, chemistry has been moderately easy to score. it usually had relative grading (unlike physics’ switch). a metakgp entry mentions “relative grading. as per session 2017-18” for chemistry wiki.metakgp.org , implying in that year it was curved. the grade distribution for chemistry (when it was relative) in one year: 132 ex, 258 a, 309 b, 229 c, 166

distribution for chemistry (when it was relative) in one year: 132 ex, 258 a, 309 b, 229 c, 166 d, 150 p, 32 f wiki.metakgp.org (this likely aggregates multiple sections). that shows a good number of top grades and a low fail percentage (~32 fails out of 1276, ~2.5%). so chemistry was indeed a subject many students scored well in – more ex/a combined (about 30% of students got ex/a) compared to physics or math. this matches the student sentiment: “majority of the course content is quite simple as it has been covered in jee syllabus… the approach is different but if you follow the class and slides, you do fine.” wiki.metakgp.org . it’s also noted that questions in exams can be repeated from previous years quite often wiki.metakgp.org – meaning doing past papers gives you a big edge (but you must beware, sometimes they can “turn the other way round” and ask lengthy numerical problems unexpectedly wiki.metakgp.org ). on average, though, chemistry papers tend to have a predictable pattern

wiki.metakgp.org ). on average, though, chemistry papers tend to have a predictable pattern (e.g. a few theory questions from inorganic, some problem-solving from physical chem, a mechanism or two from organic). chemistry lab is typically easy pass – if you perform the experiments and write reports, almost everyone gets a or ex in the lab (it’s hard to “fail” titrating acid and base correctly given guidance). in summary, chemistry is not known for grade deflation; if anything, it’s seen as score-friendly provided one does steady work. difficulty & workload: students generally rate first-year chemistry as easy to medium difficulty. the content load is high (so many topics in one course), but individually topics aren’t extremely deep. many have seen them before. the trick is adjusting to the different perspective – e.g. in jee you solved straightforward numeric problems, here you might need to discuss an application or do an analysis (like interpret a spectroscopic result). workload

need to discuss an application or do an analysis (like interpret a spectroscopic result). workload involves attending lectures, a bit of memorization (like organic name reactions or chemistry of certain elements), and some numerical problem practice (thermo, kinetics calculations). it’s less math than physics, which some find relaxing. time commitment is mainly studying before exams; continuous assessment might include a midsem and quizzes. the course often has class tests (online/offline) – indeed they had tests: 6 marks physical, 7+7 marks inorganic & organic in one iteration wiki.metakgp.org . attending those and doing well (since they’re usually easier than the final) can buffer your grade. also, “must attend tutorials of organic” because the insight gained helps solve exam problems which can be trickier in organic chem wiki.metakgp.org . real student feedback highlights that attending class (especially for organic/inorganic parts) is important since exam questions “require the

class (especially for organic/inorganic parts) is important since exam questions “require the skills and concepts taught in class” and often differ from jee-style questions wiki.metakgp.org . that implies simply reading a book might not suffice – you need the professor’s perspective (for example, an organic mechanism taught specially in class). student tips: “practise previous years’ papers, questions are repeated often” wiki.metakgp.org – a golden tip. many students collect last 5-6 years of chemistry papers and find that a good chunk of questions recur (perhaps with tweaked values). however, be prepared for surprises – one semester they gave a lengthy numerical section unexpectedly wiki.metakgp.org . so, while focusing on past patterns, don’t neglect understanding underlying concepts. use the slides and class notes as primary resource – professors explicitly said the slides define the syllabus wiki.metakgp.org . it means if something wasn’t in slides, likely not in exam (except

the syllabus wiki.metakgp.org . it means if something wasn’t in slides, likely not in exam (except possibly some unpredictable twist). pay attention to class tests and assignments: they not only give easy marks but also indicate important topics. “no theory-based descriptive questions except 1-2 in inorganic” wiki.metakgp.org – implies mostly short answer or problem-solving, with minimal long essays, so tailor your studying accordingly (practice concise answers and problem setups rather than writing long explanatory pages). organic chemistry part: it’s recommended to attend tutorials and do all given mechanism problems. organic in iit exams often requires understanding mechanisms, not just memorizing product – so clarify why a reaction proceeds a certain way (e.g. why sn1 vs sn2 in a given scenario). physical chemistry part: ensure you understand thermodynamics derivations (but since time is short in exams, focus on applying formulas). many students reference standard textbooks (like

chunk 990 content...
is short in exams, focus on applying formulas). many students reference standard textbooks (like atkins’ physical chemistry or j.d. lee for inorganic) if they need extra clarity, but slides are usually enough. lab tips: do the pre-lab reading (know the chemical reactions involved in each experiment). this not only helps get accurate results but also impresses examiners in viva. since lab grading is lenient, just avoid any big mistakes (like breaking apparatus without reporting or consistently getting wrong results) and you’ll get an ex/p. use lab sessions to intuitively understand concepts (e.g. seeing a precipitation titration color change – link it to what you learned about complexometric titration in class). difficulty ranking: for the typical first-year student, physics is now the hardest of the three sciences (due to the conceptual rigor and tough grading introduced in recent years) – it went from easiest to hardest after 2018 wiki.metakgp.org . math is intermediate – it’s

years) – it went from easiest to hardest after 2018 wiki.metakgp.org . math is intermediate – it’s rigorous but plenty of students score well (since they’re used to math). chemistry is usually considered the easiest to score among the three, as reflected by the relatively generous grade distribution wiki.metakgp.org and student feedback wiki.metakgp.org . many students indeed plan their effort accordingly – they might devote more time to physics, ensure they don’t screw up math, and feel confident chemistry will be fine with last-minute study plus their jee foundation. however, individual mileage may vary: a student strong in physics but weak in memorization might find chemistry trickier. but statistically, chemistry has been the gpa-booster more often. for science degree students (b.s. physics/chemistry/math): those programs are quite challenging in higher years (with specialist courses) but they are beyond the scope of this undergrad focus and also have smaller class sizes and more

chunk 992 content...
but they are beyond the scope of this undergrad focus and also have smaller class sizes and more personalized grading. planning advice for basic sciences: for all first-year students: don’t underestimate any subject. the institute curriculum is designed such that all three – math, physics, chem – demand attention. historically some might have ignored chemistry to focus on math/physics; that could backfire if a tough paper comes (like that one autumn where chemistry had lengthy numericals wiki.metakgp.org ). so allocate study time to each. use midsems as gauge – if you did poorly in physics midsem, allocate extra hours before endsem, use office hours, etc. for majors in these departments: engage with your department clubs (physics society, chemical society, maths society) early – they provide mentorship, extra problems classes, etc. building a strong base in first two semesters will help in advanced courses. resource utilization: iit kgp library and online resources have tons of

subjects – many students find that once the pressure of jee is gone, they can actually enjoy the beauty of physics or math. this genuine interest can naturally lead to better understanding and hence better grades. humanities & social sciences (hss) and interdisciplinary areas role in curriculum: humanities and social science courses are an integral part of iit kharagpur’s curriculum. all students must take a few hss electives (often 2-3 courses) during their degree erp.iitkgp.ac.in erp.iitkgp.ac.in . these include subjects like economics, english, psychology, sociology, etc., offered by the dept. of hss or management school. additionally, iit kgp has specific programs in hss (like a 5-year m.sc. in economics) and interdisciplinary fields like ai/ml, data science, ocean engineering, aerospace engineering, etc., which blend core engineering with specialized topics. we address both sets: the hss electives for general students and the specialized interdisciplinary programs. hss electives

hss electives for general students and the specialized interdisciplinary programs. hss electives & courses course options & details: common hss courses chosen by students include economics, psychology, sociology, literature/english, management and finance basics. for instance, hs13003 – english for communication is a compulsory course in first year focusing on technical communication skills erp.iitkgp.ac.in . later, students choose electives like hs2001x – sociology, hs300-level economics courses, or even hs4xxxx advanced humanities if interested. some popular electives (as per student consensus) are introduction to economics, industrial psychology, creative writing, foreign policy, etc. also, courses from vinod gupta school of management (vgsom) such as introduction to financial management, corporate finance & accounting can count as hss/breadth electives – these are quite sought after reddit.com . these courses typically have no heavy prerequisites (just interest and maybe basic

reddit.com . these courses typically have no heavy prerequisites (just interest and maybe basic high-school knowledge). they are usually 3 credits (3-0-0 format, purely lecture). faculty & teaching: hss faculty are experts in their fields (phds in economics, literature, etc.). they are often very passionate and use interactive teaching methods – discussions, case studies, etc., unlike the mostly lecture/problem style in technical courses. for example, a student noted that “intro to social psychology – prof is lajawaab (amazing) and includes activities too” reddit.com , indicating a highly engaging class with participatory learning. generally, class sizes in these electives might be smaller than first-year science classes, enabling more interaction. professors encourage questions, essays, and sometimes group projects or presentations, which is a different flavor of coursework for engineering students. the teaching reputation for many hss courses is that they are refreshing and

engineering students. the teaching reputation for many hss courses is that they are refreshing and enlightening, providing new perspectives beyond engineering. also, many hss profs are lenient and supportive since they know most students are from other disciplines exploring something new reddit.com . grading & workload: hss courses often have different evaluation patterns – essays, presentations, open-book tests, etc., in addition to or instead of traditional exams. grading in hss is generally considered lenient to moderate. these courses are known as gpa boosters if you put in some effort. for example, a reddit compilation listed hss/management electives and noted: “course load: moderate; grading: moderate if you put decent effort; profs: supportive” reddit.com . that implies you won’t be curve-crushed; if you do the work (submit assignments, participate), a good grade (a or ex) is attainable. indeed, a number of students secure a’s in electives like economics or psychology which

attainable. indeed, a number of students secure a’s in electives like economics or psychology which boosts their overall gpa. difficulty: conceptually, hss subjects can be very interesting but not as “hard” in the sense of complex math or physics. the challenge for engineering students might be writing long answers or essays (something they’re less used to). but since evaluation often rewards clear articulation of ideas (not one “right answer”), most manage well. workload might include reading chapters, writing short essays or reports, maybe a term paper. hours per week are modest – perhaps 2-3 hours outside class at most, which is a relief compared to, say, coding assignments in core courses. known easy electives: the redditor’s list recommended courses like introduction to financial management, corporate finance & accounting, financial & legal aspects of business – all management courses known for being practical and not too time-consuming reddit.com . also, humanities like

courses known for being practical and not too time-consuming reddit.com . also, humanities like psychology or sociology often have straightforward exams (definitions, short notes, etc.) and professors give generous partial credit. student feedback & tips: “take hss courses with good profs, you’ll enjoy and score” is common advice. students often ask seniors which hss elective to take for an “easy a.” based on feedback: psychology – fun and interactive; economics – useful and moderately easy if you are comfortable with some formulas and logic (for non-econ majors, the intro econ course is quite accessible, covering supply-demand, basic macro – engineers often do well since it’s analytical). english/literature – improves soft skills, profs usually grade kindly unless your writing is completely off. one tip: choose an hss subject that genuinely interests you, not just for ease, because interest will make the minor effort enjoyable and you’ll likely do even better. many students loved

chunk 1000 content...
interest will make the minor effort enjoyable and you’ll likely do even better. many students loved courses like development economics or philosophy of science because they got to think and discuss rather than just compute answers. also, participation can matter – in small hss classes, profs notice who speaks up; being engaged can leave a positive impression that might reflect in grading on subjective assignments. if there’s a term paper, start early and maybe get feedback on a draft – hss profs appreciate that and might give guidance that basically secures you an a. from a planning perspective, use hss electives strategically: e.g., when you have a heavy technical semester, slot in a lighter hss then to balance. students have effectively used hss courses to reduce stress in tough semesters and simultaneously learn new things. ai/ml, data science, interdisciplinary programs artificial intelligence and machine learning (ai/ml): iit kharagpur recently introduced a b.tech in artificial

intelligence and machine learning (ai/ml): iit kharagpur recently introduced a b.tech in artificial intelligence (ai) and also offers ai as a dual degree specialization for various departments erp.iitkgp.ac.in erp.iitkgp.ac.in . the ai curriculum is an interdisciplinary mix of cse, math, and domain-specific ai courses. core courses include programming, data structures (from cse), linear algebra and probability (from math) as early essentials, and then specialized courses like machine learning, deep learning, artificial intelligence (foundations), neural networks, data mining etc., typically from 3rd year onwards. there are also ai application courses (ai in vision, nlp, etc.). difficulty & workload: these courses are coding and math heavy. however, since many ai/ml courses are offered by cse or maths departments, the grading style is similar – a combination of programming assignments/projects and exams. students in ai find the workload significant (lots of projects in ml courses), but

chunk 1002 content...
and exams. students in ai find the workload significant (lots of projects in ml courses), but the interest level is high. if one has good programming skills and math aptitude, scoring is not an issue; many actually perform well because projects can earn high marks (often teamwork is allowed). for example, a course like cs60050 – machine learning (autumn, taught by cse profs) involves a project that carries weight – historically, such courses have high average grades because motivated teams do impressive projects (and profs tend to reward them). also, ai being a new program, the cohort is usually very competent (high jee ranks), so internal competition might be strong but also pushes collective performance up. faculty & alignment: ai/ml courses are taught by both cse faculty (some from the ai lab) and math/ee faculty who specialize in ml. they are up-to-date with current research, making courses very relevant. students report that courses like deep learning are “quite math-intensive

chunk 1003 content...
courses very relevant. students report that courses like deep learning are “quite math-intensive (lots of linear algebra, calculus for backpropagation) but extremely engaging”. advice: if you’re an ai/ml student, ensure you have your coding fundamentals solid early (the program will throw python, algorithms, data science libraries at you quick). also, manage time on projects – these can eat time if you let them. but the upside: scoring potential in ai/ml courses is good if you put in the work; many projects allow creativity, and hitting milestones (even if results aren’t state-of-art) usually gets you decent marks, and exams are often open-book or take-home to test understanding rather than memorization. data science & mathematics computing: iitkgp offers a 5-year integrated m.sc. in mathematics and computing, and a relatively new bs-ms in statistics and data science erp.iitkgp.ac.in . these programs combine advanced math, statistics, and programming. students in these programs take

these programs combine advanced math, statistics, and programming. students in these programs take core math courses (analysis, algebra, etc.) plus specialized courses like statistical inference, machine learning, big data analytics, etc. the difficulty is high – essentially you’re doing both a math and a cs degree in one. but again, these students are usually very strong in math, so they cope. grades in stats courses can be generous if the class is small and everyone does well. example: a course like ma51117 – time series & forecasting (masters level stat course) might have grade distribution skewed to high grades if everyone mastered the content raw.githubusercontent.com (since often in higher electives, profs give high marks if students meet expectations). data science students often do projects as well (analysis of real datasets) which are graded on insight, not just one correct answer – so if you demonstrate good effort and understanding, you score. for those not in the program

chunk 1005 content...
– so if you demonstrate good effort and understanding, you score. for those not in the program but taking data science electives: they are considered fairly scoring and very useful. ocean engineering & naval architecture: this is a distinct dept at kgp offering b.tech and dual degree. it combines civil, mechanical, and aerospace concepts applied to oceans. courses include fluid dynamics, ship design, offshore structures, etc. these tend to be quite challenging (fluid dynamics at an advanced level, structural analysis for ships) but the cohort is small. typically, small department effect: grading might be kinder because each student is more individually evaluated. unless you’re in that program, you’d only encounter these if you choose an elective like dynamics of ocean vehicles raw.githubusercontent.com or offshore technology. those who do take such electives (usually naval arch students themselves or interested others) often find them challenging but niche. if you’re not in the

themselves or interested others) often find them challenging but niche. if you’re not in the program, such courses might be harder to score in due to unfamiliar context – however, for departmental students, professors ensure most can pass and learn rather than fail out. aerospace engineering: aerospace courses at iitkgp (offered by the aerospace engineering dept.) include aerodynamics, propulsion, flight mechanics, structures – which are known to be math and physics heavy (compressible flow, orbital mechanics, etc.). they can be among the toughest engineering courses due to the complex physics (e.g. solving supersonic flow equations). however, like ocean engg, class sizes are moderate and if you’re dedicated, professors mentor closely. grades vary but it’s observed that core aerospace (like compressible aerodynamics, propulsion) often have strict grading because the standards are high (you’re training rocket scientists!). students in aero say courses are tough but there’s a strong

chunk 1007 content...
(you’re training rocket scientists!). students in aero say courses are tough but there’s a strong camaraderie and faculty support. not many outside the dept take these as electives except perhaps introduction to aircraft engineering (which might be a lighter survey course). interdisciplinary dual degrees: iitkgp offers many dual-degree options where one can do b.tech in parent dept and m.tech in an interdisciplinary field (financial engineering, engineering entrepreneurship, quality engineering design & manufacturing, etc.) erp.iitkgp.ac.in erp.iitkgp.ac.in . these programs add a specialization – e.g. financial engineering dual adds courses like advanced economics, quantitative finance. those courses (often handled by management or maths departments) are generally not extremely difficult for engineering students – e.g. an engineer can handle the math of financial models – and in fact such courses are known to be quite scoring. one reason: the class is small (only dual degree students)

chunk 1008 content...
courses are known to be quite scoring. one reason: the class is small (only dual degree students) and often evaluation is project-based (like doing a finance case study). similarly, engineering entrepreneurship adds some management and entrepreneurship courses – often involving business plan presentations, etc., which are graded leniently (almost everyone gets a/b because it’s about the experience). so, these interdisciplinary duals often have high scoring potential, and students chose them for interest plus the edge in placements, without fear of gpa damage. the trade-off is extra workload in final year, but since by then you’re doing mostly specialization courses and thesis, you manage. actionable advice for course planning (general): balance hard & soft: each semester, try to mix demanding technical courses with at least one lighter or different-type course. e.g., if you have three math-intensive courses, take one humanities or management course that semester for relief. as we saw,

chunk 1009 content...
courses, take one humanities or management course that semester for relief. as we saw, students explicitly recommend taking electives that “offer a good balance between academic learning and practical application” reddit.com – which often also means a balance between effort and reward. the list of best electives included both technical and hss subjects, chosen for moderate grading and useful knowledge. use electives to explore and boost gpa: don’t take all “chill” courses just for gpa – use a couple electives to explore interests (maybe an ml elective if you’re curious, or a creative writing class for fun). but also keep an eye on gpa-critical semesters – if core courses are very hard in a term, pick at least one known-easy elective (seniors’ wisdom or metakgp can identify which are chill). the difference of one a in an elective can offset a c in a core in terms of spi (semester performance index). consult the grade statistics: metakgp wiki and instiinfo often have previous year grade

index). consult the grade statistics: metakgp wiki and instiinfo often have previous year grade distributions for electives wiki.metakgp.org wiki.metakgp.org . for instance, an elective where historically half the class gets a or ex is a safe bet for scoring (e.g. one saw easy-to-moderate difficulty, mostly familiar content; previous grade distribution: very few low grades wiki.metakgp.org for a biotech elective bt60002). so do a quick check – these resources help identify grade inflation courses versus tough ones. plan prerequisites and interests: if you plan to do a thesis or specialize, line up prerequisites early. say you’re a mechanical student eyeing robotics in 4th year – ensure you take control systems elective earlier. or if a cse student wanting to delve into ai, take probability/statistics elective beforehand. smart planning means you won’t be scrambling to learn basics during an advanced elective, making it easier to excel. be mindful of credit load: don’t max out credits

an advanced elective, making it easier to excel. be mindful of credit load: don’t max out credits every semester. iitkgp allows a range of credits – taking a slightly lower load (while meeting minimum) in a semester with tough courses can help you focus and score better in each. you can compensate by taking a few extra credits in a lighter semester (like final year after placements). many students do this: keep 6th semester a bit lighter if it’s heavy core-wise, and push an elective or two to 8th sem which is often freer. leverage summer/winter for backlogs or extras: if you unfortunately underperform and say get an f in a course, kgp has summer term options to redo some courses. it’s not ideal, but keep it in mind that failing one course is not the end; you can recover it. conversely, use winter short courses or moocs to bolster knowledge for electives (e.g. do a mooc on machine learning in summer, then take the ml elective – you’ll ace it because you’ve seen material before). talk

in summer, then take the ml elective – you’ll ace it because you’ve seen material before). talk to academic counselors: iit kgp often has academic mentorship programs – older students or faculty advisors can help tailor a course plan. for example, if you want to go for research, they might suggest taking an extra reading course or a challenging elective with a particular professor. if you want an easier route, they might guide which courses to avoid together. extracurricular balance: while planning courses, consider your non-academic commitments (projects, club activities, internships prep). if you know you’ll spend a lot of time on a tech competition or say organizing spring fest in a semester, maybe avoid taking five heavy electives then. by strategically selecting courses and managing your time and efforts, you can build a smart course plan that meets your academic goals, keeps your gpa healthy, and allows you to explore interests. in summary, iit kharagpur’s curriculum is rich and

related to mess operations, maintenance, sports, games, cultural events, and library services are actively managed by elected general secretaries and overseen by the hall president.5 this blend of top-down administration and bottom-up student governance ensures that student preferences and needs are directly considered in the day-to-day functioning of their living environment. the kgpt app could further facilitate this by providing direct communication channels with hall authorities and student representatives, or by offering information on how students can get involved in hall management and various activities, thereby empowering them and fostering a more responsive and tailored residential experience.4. mess & food facilities: dining at iitkgpthe provision of food services at iit kharagpur's halls of residence is a critical component of student welfare, managed through a hybrid model. catering services are provided by a combination of regular hall staff members in some halls and

chunk 1040 content...
catering services are provided by a combination of regular hall staff members in some halls and outsourced to private agencies in others.5 the institute itself furnishes the mess premises, including cooking and dining facilities, furniture, food and raw material containers, appliances, utensils, electricity, and water. conversely, the responsibility for providing raw materials, food articles, cooking fuel, cleaning materials, and manpower rests with the contracted agencies.21 in addition to the main mess facilities, each hall of residence is equipped with its own canteen, offering supplementary dining options.7mess operations and quality are subject to rigorous oversight. the hall management centre (hmc) plays a central role in monitoring these operations, with a dedicated coordinating warden (mess 1) specifically tasked with overseeing "mess food and quality affairs, tendering for mess service providers and purchase of utensils".5 student involvement is also significant, as

curry, curd, and sweets for lunch/dinner.24 to ensure quality and consistency, specific brands are mandated for certain mess commodities, including salt (tata/annapurna), spices (mdh/everest/sunrise/i. shakti/ashirwad), oils (sundrop/emami/saffola/fortune for sunflower; dhara/engine/fortune/ganesh/ruchi for mustard), and dairy products (amul/mother dairy for butter/milk/paneer).21 typical mess timings are: breakfast from 6:45 am to 9:00 am, lunch from 11:45 am to 2:00 pm, evening snacks from 4:30 pm to 6:00 pm, and dinner from 6:45 pm to 9:00 pm.21 packing of food from the mess is generally not allowed.26 special provisions are also made for summer mess operations, with specific resolutions discussed and implemented by the hmc with outsourced contractors.27the operational model for mess services, which combines in-house staff with outsourced private agencies 5, presents a balanced approach. despite this operational diversity, the institute maintains stringent quality control through

chunk 1044 content...
despite this operational diversity, the institute maintains stringent quality control through regular "mess quality assessment" initiatives 5 and "surprise inspections" by a dedicated food and mess monitoring committee.22 the mandate for specific brands of commodities further reinforces a commitment to consistent quality across all providers.21 this robust monitoring system highlights the institute's proactive stance in ensuring student satisfaction and maintaining high standards of hygiene and nutrition in a large, multi-vendor catering environment. the kgpt app could enhance this by integrating a feedback mechanism for mess quality, allowing students to directly contribute to the ongoing oversight efforts.a significant aspect of mess management is its student-centric approach. the fact that "activities related to mess operations and monitoring... are managed by various elected general secretaries and overseen by the hall president" 5 indicates substantial student involvement in the

comprehensive q&a compendium: insights into iit kharagpur student lifei. introduction to iit kharagpur student experienceiit kharagpur stands as a monumental institution in india's academic landscape, recognized as the oldest and largest indian institute of technology. its sprawling campus, encompassing 2100 acres, is often described as magnificent and among the best in the nation. this extensive footprint allows for the accommodation of a vast student body across the highest number of departments compared to other iits, fostering a diverse and dynamic academic environment.1 this report aims to provide a detailed overview of the student experience at iit kharagpur, drawing from various student discussions and official communications, covering academic pursuits, campus and hostel life, student welfare, career development, and the robust alumni network.the sheer scale and diversity of iit kharagpur, while offering unparalleled opportunities, can also present unique challenges. the large

chunk 1089 content...
kharagpur, while offering unparalleled opportunities, can also present unique challenges. the large student population and extensive campus, while facilitating a wide range of interactions and activities, may inadvertently contribute to feelings of isolation for some students or make it difficult to forge deep, dependable connections.2 this inherent characteristic of a large institution means that while numerous resources and avenues for engagement exist, the individual student experience can vary significantly, sometimes leading to a sense of being overlooked or a struggle to navigate the vast social landscape. understanding this dynamic is crucial for both prospective students and the institution itself, as it highlights the need for proactive engagement with support systems and peer networks to thrive within such an expansive setting.ii. academic life and curriculumacademic rigor and performance are central to the iit kharagpur experience, with significant emphasis placed on

chunk 1090 content...
and performance are central to the iit kharagpur experience, with significant emphasis placed on consistent effort and strategic course selection. the institution's curriculum is designed to challenge students while offering various pathways for specialization and skill development.the importance of academic performanceq: what is the importance of cgpa (cumulative grade point average) at iit kharagpur?a: the cumulative grade point average (cgpa) holds paramount importance at iit kharagpur, particularly the first-year cgpa. it is widely acknowledged that a strong academic start is crucial, as it becomes exceedingly difficult to significantly improve a low cgpa in subsequent years. therefore, consistent academic performance from the outset is vital.3 a cgpa of 8.0 or higher is frequently cited as a minimum cut-off criterion for securing desirable internships and placement opportunities with various companies.3 while practical skills are increasingly valued in the professional world, a

chunk 1091 content...
various companies.3 while practical skills are increasingly valued in the professional world, a solid cgpa often serves as the initial gateway to these career-advancing opportunities.1this dual emphasis on academic scores and practical competencies creates a demanding environment for students. they are expected not only to maintain high grades but also to actively develop skills beyond the curriculum. this constant balancing act can lead to considerable pressure, as students strive to meet both the quantitative benchmarks of cgpa and the qualitative demands of skill acquisition for future career success.q: how important is programming for students at iit kharagpur, especially for non-computer science backgrounds?a: programming proficiency is highly significant for students at iit kharagpur, irrespective of their primary academic discipline. its importance is particularly pronounced during placement seasons, where a strong command of programming skills can significantly enhance career

chunk 1092 content...
placement seasons, where a strong command of programming skills can significantly enhance career prospects.3 for students whose classroom instruction in programming may not be sufficient, the institution implicitly encourages self-directed learning through online platforms. resources such as geeksforgeeks, hackerrank, hackerearth, and interviewbit are commonly recommended for supplementary learning and practice.3course structure and specializationq: what are the key considerations for department change (depc) at iit kharagpur?a: department change (depc) is a highly sought-after objective for many first-year students at iit kharagpur, often viewed as a pathway to a preferred specialization.1 the criteria for depc vary depending on the academic session format. in online academic sessions, seven specific theory subjects were considered for the change, whereas in offline sessions, all subjects except "engineering arts and aesthetics" (eaa) are taken into account.4 students who are serious

chunk 1093 content...
except "engineering arts and aesthetics" (eaa) are taken into account.4 students who are serious about pursuing a department change are strongly advised to prioritize their academics above all else and limit their involvement in numerous extracurricular activities during their initial year.1the intense focus on department change, coupled with the extremely competitive cgpa requirements—sometimes demanding a cgpa of 9.7 to 10.0 for a successful branch change, particularly into highly coveted branches like computer science engineering 5—creates a significant internal competition among first-year students. this pursuit of a "better" or more preferred branch can lead to immense academic pressure. it may also inadvertently discourage students from exploring a wider range of interests or from fully engaging in social and personal development during their foundational year, as the emphasis shifts heavily towards maximizing academic scores. this phenomenon suggests a potential trade-off

chunk 1094 content...
shifts heavily towards maximizing academic scores. this phenomenon suggests a potential trade-off between early academic specialization and a more holistic initial college experience, contributing to the overall high-pressure academic environment within the institution.q: what are "additional subjects" and "breadth subjects" at iit kharagpur?a: iit kharagpur's curriculum includes distinct categories of subjects to allow for both specialization and broader learning.additional subjects: these are elective courses that students can opt for starting from their third year to explore areas of interest beyond their core curriculum. to be eligible, a student must maintain a cumulative grade point average (cgpa) of 7.50 or higher and have no outstanding backlogs. students meeting these criteria are permitted to take a maximum of five additional subjects per semester. it is important to note that the grades obtained in these additional subjects do not contribute to a student's semester grade

chunk 1095 content...
the grades obtained in these additional subjects do not contribute to a student's semester grade point average (sgpa) or overall cgpa.4breadth subjects: in contrast, breadth subjects are a mandatory component of the curriculum. these courses are typically unrelated to a student's primary department, designed to provide a broader educational foundation. unlike additional subjects, the grades earned in breadth subjects directly contribute to a student's overall cgpa.4postgraduate academic experienceq: what is the m.tech academic experience like at iit kharagpur?a: the academic experience for m.tech students at iit kharagpur is characterized by an intensive first year, particularly for those in computer science engineering (cse). the initial year is described as "hectic," indicating a demanding workload and rigorous coursework. however, the second year of the m.tech program typically involves no formal courses, shifting the focus primarily to research and thesis work.6 iit kharagpur is

the ph.d degree" if it fails to meet their stringent standards.7the doctoral journey necessitates extensive engagement with existing literature, requiring researchers to delve into vast volumes of published works within their chosen field. this exhaustive study is critical for identifying gaps in current knowledge, which then informs the framing of precise and coherent objectives that guide the entire research project.7 the process is often likened to navigating a tunnel, a solitary journey marked by periods of both clarity and profound uncertainty. researchers must consistently marshal their intellectual resources, demonstrate unwavering perseverance, and exhibit considerable courage to make progress, especially during moments of darkness, until a "light is visible at the end of the tunnel".7 successfully completing this arduous project is described as an exhilarating experience, akin to a "second birth," signifying a profound personal and intellectual transformation.7q: what kind of

chunk 1098 content...
a "second birth," signifying a profound personal and intellectual transformation.7q: what kind of interview questions can phd candidates expect, particularly in computer science related fields?a: during phd interviews, particularly in computer science and related domains, interviewers typically aim to assess a candidate's fundamental understanding of core concepts and their ability to apply mathematical reasoning, rather than merely testing memorized facts. questions often span foundational areas such as linear algebra, where candidates might be asked to determine the number of solutions for systems of equations, or probability. in data structures, common inquiries include identifying the most efficient data structure for a specific implementation, analyzing time complexity for various operations, and explaining the underlying principles that contribute to efficiency, such as why logarithmic time complexity (log(n)) is significant in data structures like heaps.7 candidates are

academic preparationq: what are some tips for jee advanced preparation, according to iit kgp students?a: current students at iit kharagpur offer practical advice for preparing for the jee advanced examination. one key recommendation is to practice mock tests in a shorter duration, specifically 2 hours and 30 minutes instead of the full 3 hours. this strategy is intended to build additional "breathing space" for the actual exam day, which can help manage stress and panic, thereby maximizing performance.5 for boosting preparation in the final stages, students are advised to push themselves by solving problems that necessitate "out-of-the-box" thinking, helping them adapt to the unique problem-solving demands of jee advanced. relying on coaching materials, irodov, and specific "black books" is also suggested.9 furthermore, for subjects like electrochemistry and ionic equilibrium, it is recommended to study them thoroughly enough to handle jee mains level questions, as highly difficult

chunk 1117 content...
use their hostel rooms for sleeping and resting, encouraging them to engage with the broader campus environment for other activities.13 after classes, it is recommended to utilize facilities such as the undergraduate (ug) complex, sports complex, mac (presumably a multi-activity center), the library, or to visit other hostels.13 the evening hours are specifically highlighted as a time meant for going out and engaging in social or recreational activities, with the suggestion that students should avoid remaining in their rooms during this period.13q: what are the living conditions like in the hostels, and how do they impact mental health?a: the living conditions in hostels at iit kharagpur can be quite challenging, and these conditions are reported to significantly affect student mental health. factors such as hot and humid weather, frequent power failures, and occasional water shortages, especially during examination periods, collectively contribute to a stressful environment.2 these

chunk 1118 content...
especially during examination periods, collectively contribute to a stressful environment.2 these physical discomforts add a substantial burden to the already demanding academic pressures, leading to a noticeable toll on students' psychological well-being.2the explicit connection drawn between "extremely poor living conditions" and their impact on mental health indicates that environmental stressors are a significant, often overlooked, component of student distress. this suggests that a comprehensive approach to student well-being at iit kharagpur must extend beyond psychological counseling to include tangible improvements in basic infrastructure and living quality. addressing these environmental factors could alleviate a considerable source of stress, thereby contributing to a more supportive and conducive living and learning atmosphere.iv. student welfare and mental healthstudent welfare and mental health are critical areas of focus at iit kharagpur, with various institutional

welfare and mental health are critical areas of focus at iit kharagpur, with various institutional mechanisms and student-led initiatives in place to provide support, address grievances, and ensure a safe environment. however, student narratives also highlight ongoing challenges.mental health support and challengesq: what are the common mental health challenges faced by iit kharagpur students?a: many students at iit kharagpur experience significant mental health challenges, frequently manifesting as persistent feelings of being low, a diminished capacity for happiness, and in severe cases, suicidal ideation.14 these symptoms are often attributed to intense social pressure and the high, sometimes unreasonable, expectations students place upon themselves.14 specific issues contributing to this distress include a perceived lack of genuine interactions, difficulty in forming dependable friendships and bonds, an intensely competitive atmosphere, a noticeable lack of empathy among peers, a

chunk 1120 content...
and bonds, an intensely competitive atmosphere, a noticeable lack of empathy among peers, a tendency towards introspection rather than outward engagement, and a general failure to be observant of one's surroundings.2 the gravity of this situation is underscored by observations that student suicides are becoming a disturbingly normalized occurrence within the community.2the recurring discussions of student suicides and widespread depression within the student body, alongside formal institutional support systems like the counseling center 11 and a mental health expert panel 12, reveal a complex and multi-faceted problem. student voices often attribute part of this distress to perceived harsh treatment from professors, including strict attendance policies and the teaching of irrelevant course material.2 simultaneously, students acknowledge their own role in the social fabric, pointing to a breakdown in peer support characterized by a lack of genuine interactions and empathy. this

chunk 1121 content...
to a breakdown in peer support characterized by a lack of genuine interactions and empathy. this indicates that the mental health crisis is not merely an issue of individual coping mechanisms but stems from a confluence of academic pressures, administrative policies, and a deteriorating culture of mutual support among students. effective solutions necessitate a holistic approach that addresses these interconnected factors, aiming to foster a more supportive, communicative, and less stigmatized environment.q: what should a student do if they feel depressed or notice someone else behaving abnormally/depressed?a: if a student experiences feelings of depression or is navigating a particularly difficult period in their life, they are strongly encouraged to schedule an appointment with a counselor at the institute's dedicated counseling centre.11 the centre can be reached via email at cc@adm.iitkgp.ernet.in, or by phone at 03222 281175, 281173, 221174, or 281108. personal visits are also

chunk 1134 content...
overly comfortable in their personal spaces and do not engage adequately with others, is seen as a fundamental cause of social isolation and contributes to the overall mental distress experienced by the student body.2q: what is the responsibility of students in preventing suicides on campus?a: the responsibility for preventing suicides on campus is significantly placed on the student community itself. students are urged to remain vigilant and attentive to any changes in their friends' behavior.2 a crucial aspect of this involves creating an environment where friends feel sufficiently comfortable and secure to open up about their problems and rely on each other for support. this necessitates fostering a level of trust where vulnerabilities can be shared without fear of exploitation.2 students are encouraged to proactively check in on their friends, engage in casual conversations without a specific reason, and be willing to apologize if they realize they have inadvertently caused

by students.2the discrepancy between the detailed institutional support systems for mental health, ragging, and sexual harassment, as outlined in official documents, and the student narratives of widespread distress, including suicides and challenging living conditions, points to a critical gap. while formal mechanisms exist, student experiences suggest they may be insufficient, underutilized, or overshadowed by other stressors such as academic pressures and perceived administrative rigidity. this indicates that policies alone are not enough; there is a need for a greater focus on effective implementation, fostering a more empathetic campus culture, and potentially destigmatizing the use of support services. addressing the root causes of stress, including academic expectations and living conditions, alongside psychological support, is essential for a more effective approach to student well-being.table 3: essential student support contactsthis table consolidates critical contact

about the efficiency and reliability of railway parcel services.21viii. conclusionthe student experience at iit kharagpur is characterized by a unique blend of immense academic opportunities, a vast and vibrant campus life, and a complex social environment. the institution, as the oldest and largest iit, provides an unparalleled platform for intellectual and personal growth, attracting students with its diverse departments and extensive facilities.a central theme emerging from student perspectives is the intense academic pressure, particularly concerning the cumulative grade point average (cgpa) and the pursuit of department change (depc). while a high cgpa is crucial for initial career opportunities, students also face the challenge of simultaneously developing practical skills, creating a demanding dual expectation. the postgraduate experience, particularly the phd journey, is depicted as profoundly rigorous, requiring exceptional perseverance and intellectual depth, yet culminating

as profoundly rigorous, requiring exceptional perseverance and intellectual depth, yet culminating in a transformative personal and professional achievement.campus life, though set in a rural area that some perceive as a drawback for external opportunities, is celebrated for its expansive green spaces and comprehensive on-campus amenities. however, this vastness, coupled with a skewed gender ratio, can contribute to feelings of isolation and a perceived lack of genuine social interactions among students. this social dynamic, alongside challenging living conditions like frequent power outages and humid weather, significantly impacts student mental well-being. the recurring discussions around mental health struggles and suicides highlight a critical area of concern, suggesting that while formal support mechanisms are in place, their effectiveness may be hampered by underlying cultural issues, academic pressures, and perceived administrative insensitivity. this indicates a need for a

academics & curriculum q: how important is cgpa and how is it calculated? a: at iit kharagpur, cgpa (cumulative grade point average) is a weighted average of course grades (ex=10, a=9, b=8, etc.) multiplied by their credits, divided by total credits reddit.com . many seniors emphasize maintaining at least ~8.0 cgpa, since a lot of top companies use an 8+ cutoff for internships and placements reddit.com . a high cgpa also helps in branch changes (when it existed) and in applications for foreign ms/phd programs reddit.com . you don’t necessarily need a “dassi” (perfect 10); keeping it above 8 is usually enough to avoid stress and unlock most opportunities reddit.com . (in kgp lingo, a cgpa 7-8 is called “satti”, 8-9 “atthi”, and 9+ “nehli” metakgp.org .) lower cgpa can be compensated by skills, but it may “close some initial doors”, so students often advise to focus on academics in early semesters when courses are easier reddit.com reddit.com . if your first-year gpa is lower than hoped

a: course registration at kgp is done online via the erp portal each semester. core courses are pre-allotted, but for electives (professional, hss, management breadths, etc.), you often have to choose preferences. if your desired elective is not showing up in the list or is full, you can still apply to the course instructor for a seat on erp erp.iitkgp.ac.in erp.iitkgp.ac.in . the erp has a facility to send a request to the professor; if they approve your join request, the course becomes available for you to register erp.iitkgp.ac.in erp.iitkgp.ac.in . many students do this to get into popular hss/management electives that fill up fast. if you were randomly allotted a breadth (due to not pre-selecting), you can try to change it by applying for other subjects where seats are open (or even full – via instructor approval) erp.iitkgp.ac.in erp.iitkgp.ac.in . the subject registration faq released by the academic section clarifies that you are not strictly limited to the initial allotment;

by the academic section clarifies that you are not strictly limited to the initial allotment; with instructor permission, you may switch to an elective of your choice as long as prerequisites and timetable allow erp.iitkgp.ac.in erp.iitkgp.ac.in . if you have a time slot clash between a backlog course and another, you are allowed to register the backlog in a different section that fits your schedule (you don’t have to stick to your original section) erp.iitkgp.ac.in . for additional courses (above your required credits), ensure you meet the 7.5 cgpa/no-f eligibility before attempting to add them erp.iitkgp.ac.in . in summary, use the erp wisely: fill preferences on time, monitor allotments, and leverage the online request to instructor feature if you need to get into a specific elective erp.iitkgp.ac.in . if anything goes wrong (prerequisite issues, etc.), the academic section usually provides help – e.g. the erp manual (and faq pdf) explains common issues and fixes. and don’t forget

help – e.g. the erp manual (and faq pdf) explains common issues and fixes. and don’t forget to confirm registration before the deadline and print the subject registration slip from erp as proof, a step many students nearly miss in first year! q: what are the toughest courses in the curriculum and any hacks to survive them? a: this of course varies by department, but certain core courses at kgp have a reputation campus-wide. for instance, mathematics courses like ma201 (pde) or core electronics courses can be notoriously heavy. many seniors say first year courses are relatively easy – so scoring well in 1st year is important to buffer your cgpa reddit.com . the difficulty often spikes in second year core subjects. strategies to cope include forming study groups, using library resources (iit kgp’s central library is stocked with course textbooks and past year papers), and seeking senior notes/question papers – these are goldmines for courses that repeat similar exam patterns. it’s

notes/question papers – these are goldmines for courses that repeat similar exam patterns. it’s common for students to obtain a question bank of previous years for subjects like mechanics, control systems, etc., since profs often have limited question pools. hacks to pass (or even excel) often involve smart prioritization: identify which portion of the syllabus carries most weight and focus on understanding those thoroughly rather than trying to mug everything last minute. also, learn from senior experiences – for example, some professors are known to be lenient with grading or give open-book exams, while others are very strict. adjust your strategy accordingly (some seniors even pick electives by checking which professor is offering it, to gauge grading leniency). for “killer” courses, start assignments early (many people taapna – copy – assignments last minute, but attempting them yourself helps understand tricky concepts that often turn up in exams). attend classes regularly if the

helps understand tricky concepts that often turn up in exams). attend classes regularly if the prof gives attendance or surprise quizzes – missing those can drag your grade down even if you ace the final. one specific kgp tip: take advantage of supplementary exams and summer term if you do fail a core course – kgp allows you to re-attempt a failed subject in summer to avoid losing a year. as for easy hacks, students share recommendations for “cgpa booster” electives: for example, courses like consumer psychology/happiness, certain foreign language courses (german), and some management or hss courses have a history of high average grades with modest effort. one kgpian joked that in the happiness course, “do good you get b, do bad you get b – if you got a c you’re a genius”, implying almost everyone gets at least a b grade reddit.com reddit.com . another student swore by german language elective as “the best – you can easily pull off an ex with just 1 day of study before exams”

elective as “the best – you can easily pull off an ex with just 1 day of study before exams” reddit.com . of course, such tips change with instructors, but it’s common to ask seniors each semester which electives are chill. in summary: work smart – use past papers, get insights from seniors on profs and courses, start early on tough subjects – and balance your load by mixing in a lighter elective in semesters where your core subjects are heavy. everyone struggles at some point, so collaborate with batchmates (group study in nalanda classrooms, late-night bhaat sessions to trade knowledge) and you’ll get through even the nastiest courses. lastly, if you do end up with an f in a core course, don’t be demoralized – many have been there (slogging through a supplementary exam later) and still done fine in the end reddit.com , so seek help, talk to professors or tutors, and remember it’s not the end of the road. q: what about attendance requirements and grading policies? a: iit kharagpur

chunk 1187 content...
the end of the road. q: what about attendance requirements and grading policies? a: iit kharagpur generally has an attendance policy of 75% minimum in theory classes, but enforcement can vary by professor. some profs are strict and might debar (disallow) you from the end-sem exam if you attend too low (below 75%). others are lenient or offer attendance as extra credit. it’s risky to assume leniency, so try not to skip too many classes without info – especially in first year when you don’t yet know each prof’s style. a common freshman mistake is assuming “classes don’t matter like school” and then getting a shock with surprise tests or attendance penalties. as one quora answer put it: minimum mandatory attendance may feel unjust, but it does exist, so be mindful. in labs, attendance is usually compulsory since there’s continuous evaluation. grading at kgp follows the 10-point letter grade system (ex, a, b, … down to p for pass and f for fail). relative grading is common in many courses

chunk 1188 content...
system (ex, a, b, … down to p for pass and f for fail). relative grading is common in many courses – meaning your grade depends on the class distribution. in such cases, even a score of 40% might get you a b if the test was hard and everyone did poorly; conversely, in an easy elective, you might need 90%+ for an ex. some courses (especially labs and small electives) use absolute grading (fixed cutoffs). the ‘p’ grade is the lowest passing grade (usually 4 or 5 grade points, equivalent to ~40% marks); getting multiple p’s will pull down your cgpa, but at least you passed. if you unfortunately get an f (fakka), you will have to repeat the course in a later semester or in the summer term – it stays on your transcript but once you pass the retake, the new grade replaces the f in cgpa calculation (the f still shows up as a footnote). also note: iit kgp does not allow grade improvement by re-exam in a passed course – the only way to improve a grade is to do well in the first attempt (or

re-exam in a passed course – the only way to improve a grade is to do well in the first attempt (or repeat if you failed). in some exceptional cases, professors offer make-up exams if you missed an exam due to medical reasons (with dean’s approval). takeaway: attend classes enough to stay out of trouble (a senior advised: “never bunk so much that you have to beg for attendance at end”), keep track of each course’s grading scheme (quiz weights, assignment weights differ), and don’t hesitate to talk to the prof or faculty advisor if you have genuine issues – they can be accommodating if approached professionally. and yes, no cell phones in exams – kgp has strict exam rules and a disciplinary committee (disco) that deals with cheating cases, so keep it honest to avoid any “year backs” or penalties. timeline insight: first-year students commonly ask about branch change, gpa calculation, and how to ace easy courses – it’s a period focused on adjusting academically and laying a foundation.

how to ace easy courses – it’s a period focused on adjusting academically and laying a foundation. second-year questions often center on choosing minors/electives and managing tougher core courses. by pre-final year, queries shift to internships, projects and improving profiles (many realize they need to pull up cgpa or do projects for placements). final-year students are more concerned with placements vs higher studies and often reflect on academic regrets (like not exploring certain courses or research opportunities). throughout, a recurring theme is finding the balance between maintaining grades and doing other activities – a challenge every batch navigates. sources: academic faqs erp.iitkgp.ac.in erp.iitkgp.ac.in ; cgpa formula reddit.com ; alumni advice on cgpa reddit.com reddit.com ; iit-kgp branch change policy timesofindia.indiatimes.com timesofindia.indiatimes.com ; senior’s “10 points” advice reddit.com reddit.com ; student discussions on electives reddit.com reddit.com ;

have more basic facilities. for first-years, hostels are allocated randomly by the institute – most freshers get shared accommodation (2 or 3 per room) in junior halls like patel, azad, hjb, mmm etc., so there isn’t a choice. as seniors, many move to single rooms. the notion of “worst” hall often comes playfully – e.g. lala lajpat rai hall (llr) has older infrastructure and is far from some departments, which some dislike; and azad hall is infamous for being one of the farthest (and an all-senior hall with a quirky culture). but every hall has its pros: e.g. azad has a vibrant alumni legacy and one of the largest grounds; patel hall is centrally located; rk and rp halls are close to academic area. hall rivalry is mostly in good spirit, so “worst hall” is usually what other hall guys call each other’s halls in jest. objectively, the new mega-hostels (like mmm hall for postgrads/research scholars) have great facilities – mmm has dual occupancy rooms with attached bathrooms, which

scholars) have great facilities – mmm has dual occupancy rooms with attached bathrooms, which undergrads envy! reddit.com . nehru and llr have elevators (nehru even has its own night canteen “asim’s” and music room). in contrast, older halls like hjb or patel have more spartan amenities (common bathrooms, no lifts) but often tighter community. so, the “best hall” could mean best living conditions (nehru/nalini ranjan/snv for boys; mt for girls), while “worst” might refer to distance or dilapidation (some wings of oldest halls have old furniture, etc.). keep in mind that iit administration does periodic renovations – for instance, vs hall got a revamp recently. also, hall experiences can be subjective: your friend circle (“wingmates”) and hall culture (sports, music, etc.) often define how much you love your hall more than the facilities do. as one senior summarized on reddit, if it’s about rooms and mess quality, nehru wins; if it’s about hall culture and gc (general championship)

chunk 1194 content...
about rooms and mess quality, nehru wins; if it’s about hall culture and gc (general championship) victories, every hall claims they are the best! ultimately, you don’t get to choose your hall as a fresher, so embrace wherever you’re allotted – you’ll find each hall has its own charm and “tempo” (spirit) in the inter-hall competitions. q: how are the mess food and dining facilities? any hall known for good or terrible food? a: mess food at kgp is a perpetual hot topic – it ranges from decent to “dogshit” depending on whom you ask and which hall. each hall has its own mess operated either by hmc (in-house) or a private contractor reddit.com . the menus are similar (rotis, dal, sabji, with weekly treats like chicken egg curry, paneer, etc.), but quality can differ. some halls have a reputation for better food – for example, students often praise ambedkar hall’s mess; one student said “quantity and quality both are good in ambedkar’s mess – feels like home-made food” reddit.com . on the

and quality both are good in ambedkar’s mess – feels like home-made food” reddit.com . on the flip side, halls like lbs hall have spawned rants on social media for their subpar mess – complaints of half-cooked chapatis, watery dal, etc., are common. there’s even a meme that iit kgp has the worst mess food for vegetarians reddit.com – non-veg items (fish/chicken) are served frequently, whereas pure veg options can be repetitive and bland, leaving strict vegetarians unhappy. to cope, many students rely on hall canteens and night messes. every hall has a canteen (open in evenings to late night) serving snacks, maggi, and some meals for a charge. plus, there are popular night canteens like eggies (near veggies) for omelettes and shakeel’s or tikka in tech market for late-night bites. on campus, you also have eateries: vegies (a pure-veg diner), billoo’s restaurant, dreamland (dl), staqs, and cafes like ccd in the tech market, which students frequent to escape mess monotony. students often

cafes like ccd in the tech market, which students frequent to escape mess monotony. students often ask “can i eat at another hall’s mess?” – officially you are supposed to eat in your own hall’s mess (you pay a mess advance there), but informally, if you have a friend in another hall, you can occasionally join them by paying cash per meal (around ₹50-60). a trick for food variety: many halls organize mess fests or special dinners periodically (with biryani, desserts etc.), and inter-hall mess food competitions have started to encourage quality. despite efforts, complaints persist – e.g. “the food here is hilariously bad… what are my options?” asked one student, who was advised to stock fruits, visit tech market eateries, and just “bear with it” on regular days. the institute has a food monitoring committee (fmc) that inspects messes – serious issues (like stale ingredients or hygiene problems) can be officially complained about. hmc’s faq even guides to take photos and report to the

can be officially complained about. hmc’s faq even guides to take photos and report to the food & mess monitoring committee on facebook if mess hygiene is awful hmc.iitkgp.ac.in . on a positive note, things have improved over the years – you won’t starve, and you might even enjoy some hall’s cooking (e.g. omelette days or the weekly chicken curry which many look forward to). if you’re health-conscious, you may find the nutrition lacking (lots of carbs, less protein) reddit.com – seniors often supplement with their own protein foods or visit hall canteens for an extra egg curry. in summary: mess food is okay-ish, with some halls a bit better, some worse. it’s wise to keep modest expectations (typical college mess fare) and then use campus alternatives for variety. and by the way, each hall does special dinner on festivals which is usually pretty good – that’s when you realize the cooks can actually make tasty paneer and gulab jamun when they want to! q: what about hostel rooms,

chunk 1198 content...
cooks can actually make tasty paneer and gulab jamun when they want to! q: what about hostel rooms, internet, and maintenance issues? a: hostel rooms at kgp vary from older dormitories to newer apartment-style blocks. as a first-year, expect a shared room (2 or 3 persons) with basic furniture: cot, desk, chair, fan. second-years often get double or single rooms depending on hall capacity, and final-years usually get single rooms. rooms come with lights and fans, but no acs allowed (students use personal coolers in peak summer sometimes). internet: all halls have institute wi-fi and lan ports. the institute wi-fi network (called scholar or similar) is available in academic areas and hostels, but in halls the signal might be weaker in some wings. most students prefer using lan via ethernet – you can bring a wi-fi router to plug into the lan port in your room to get better wireless coverage inside your room. speeds are generally good for academic use (and late-night movie bingeing),

inside your room. speeds are generally good for academic use (and late-night movie bingeing), though in evenings it can slow if many are streaming. occasionally, a hall wing might have network outages; the official protocol then is to “contact your hall manager; if not resolved, report to the computer & informatics center (cic)” hmc.iitkgp.ac.in . students typically first complain in their hall’s technical forum or whatsapp group, and if it persists, the network staff comes and fixes the router or switch. wi-fi issues are common at semester start when 2000 new devices join – a tip is to register all your devices mac addresses on the iit network portal properly to avoid getting kicked off. for maintenance problems (leaky faucet, broken furniture, etc.), each hall has a maintenance secretary (student rep) and hall staff. the hmc guidelines say to write issues in the hall’s complaint register and inform the hall manager hmc.iitkgp.ac.in . for instance, if you have missing or broken

register and inform the hall manager hmc.iitkgp.ac.in . for instance, if you have missing or broken furniture, you inform the hall supervisor who will consolidate requests and get replacements via the warden hmc.iitkgp.ac.in . if a light or fan isn’t working, hall electricians handle it – usually you tell the guard or caretaker and they send the electrician. however, student experiences vary – some halls address complaints in a day or two, others you may have to remind multiple times. persistent issues (water not coming, major leaks) can be escalated to the assistant warden (maintenance). also, kgp’s campus maintenance is divided among institute sections (civil, electrical, etc.), so sometimes bigger repairs take time due to paperwork. a quirky persistent issue is monkeys and dogs sneaking into halls – keep your doors and windows latched to avoid surprise animal roommates! if you find too many mosquitoes breeding, students are advised to ask hall management to spray repellant and get

patterns. the result is a breathtaking display (see image below) that every kgpian carries as a fond memory metakgp.org . hall rivalries also show up as funny banter: each hall has a stereotyped image – e.g., nehru hall guys are teased as “nehru denizens think they’re princes” or rp hall called “royal palace” ironically. but when needed, halls stand united (say, against a common foe in an external sports meet). illumination (diwali) at iit kharagpur – halls compete by creating elaborate designs with diyas. “illu” is a 40+ year kgp tradition that fosters hall unity and friendly rivalry metakgp.org . apart from hall vs hall, there’s also a general campus pride in events like spring fest (sf) and kshitij (techno-management fest). spring fest is kgp’s annual social-cultural fest in january – one of the oldest and largest in india (started 1960, now draws ~80,000 attendees) en.wikipedia.org en.wikipedia.org . students often ask how to get involved: as a freshman, you can join as an sf

reach out to current core team members; they often look for keen juniors. also join clubs relevant to fest (e.g. if you’re in dramatics or photography, you’ll naturally be involved in sf events). being part of a fest team is a bonding and learning experience – you’ll likely spend sleepless nights preparing, but also forge great friendships and get an official fest t-shirt (a matter of pride!). and of course, you get bragging rights of backstage access to celebrities 😛. outside of fests, gymkhana elections and involvement are another aspect of campus life. the gymkhana is the student body that oversees clubs and fests. you’ll see posters and hear soapbox speeches during election season for posts like hall vp, g.sec (general secretary) sports/tech/soc-cult metakgp.org metakgp.org . many faqs from first-years: “should i stand for a post or join gymkhana?” – it depends on interest. if you’re passionate about improving student life or leading clubs, you can run for a post in 3rd year (most

passionate about improving student life or leading clubs, you can run for a post in 3rd year (most gymkhana positions are held by pre-final years). the election process is elaborate (and sometimes dramatic), but those who do get elected gain significant leadership experience. however, balancing gymkhana duties with academics is tough – that’s why people joke that gymkhana g.secs are always busy. so, get involved gradually: attend club g.b.m.s (general body meetings), volunteer at events – by the time you’re in 3rd year, you’ll know if you want to commit to a major role. in short, campus life at kgp is vibrant and as engaging as you make it. from cheering your hall in the 100m relay, to pulling an all-nighter building a hovercraft for tech gc, to dancing like crazy in rangmanch (sf choreography event), there’s something for everyone. the inter-hall and inter-college events are not just competitions, they’re the forge of lifelong memories. years later, alumni don’t remember class

just competitions, they’re the forge of lifelong memories. years later, alumni don’t remember class lectures as much – but they remember the night their hall lifted the illumination trophy or the excitement of spring fest. so dive in! q: what do students do for fun and leisure on campus? a: despite being in a relatively remote location, kgp campus is like a small town with plenty to do. popular leisure activities and “timepass” spots include: chhedi’s: an iconic tea stall just outside the institute main gate metakgp.org . open till late night, it’s the place for a cup of chai and bun maska at 2 am. groups of students often go on “tinku runs” to chhedi’s (fond slang from hall days referring to late-night outings) reddit.com , especially after exhausting study sessions or club meets. it’s a rite of passage to sit on the benches at chhedi’s under the starry sky and chat away – you’ll see birthday gpl victims being treated to tea, guitarists strumming, and lots of bikes/cycles parked

birthday gpl victims being treated to tea, guitarists strumming, and lots of bikes/cycles parked around. cycling around campus: kgp is a 2100-acre campus, so cycling is the primary mode of student transport. many students simply enjoy late evening cycle rides – doing a “2.2” (a 2.2 km loop around scholar’s avenue) metakgp.org , or exploring less-traveled paths like around jnan ghosh stadium or the outer periphery road by vikramshila. during full moon nights, a midnight cycle trip with friends (sometimes to the airfield or mango groves) is magical – just be sure to carry your id and a torch. chill spots: tech market is the commercial hub where you find cafes, juice stalls, stationery, a small supermarket, etc. students hang out there in the evenings – grabbing an ice cream at tinku’s ice-cream, or parathas at la juice. the nalanda and lbs lecture complex rooftops are surprisingly popular hangouts too – at night, you’ll often find couples or friend groups chilling on the nalanda terrace

hangouts too – at night, you’ll often find couples or friend groups chilling on the nalanda terrace under the open sky. scholar’s avenue (the main road) itself has lawns and the bidhan chowk (golc) circle metakgp.org , where people sit and talk (especially after hall day when everyone’s out in formals clicking pics by the main building). sports and gyms: for fitness enthusiasts, there’s the tata sports complex which houses a good gym, swimming pool, indoor badminton, squash, etc. many halls also have their own mini gyms and tt rooms. evening sports are big – you can join informal football or cricket matches on the grounds. jogging on the track at jnan ghosh or around lake side is a great way to unwind (yes, we have a couple of lakes on campus!). some also use the new pubbs bicycle-sharing to ride around for fun. night canteens: each hall’s canteen is a social hub post 10 pm. you go for a maggi or egg roll and end up spending an hour chatting. there’s friendly inter-hall visits too –

a maggi or egg roll and end up spending an hour chatting. there’s friendly inter-hall visits too – e.g., “let’s go to sn’s canteen for dosa, it’s better than ours”. veggies, the all-night veg canteen near rp hall, is famous for its chai and aloo parathas at 4 am. movies and lan: with the high-speed lan, binge-watching tv series or playing lan games is a favored pastime. a lot of hostels organize lan gaming tourneys (counter-strike, dota etc.), and it’s common to hear cheers and shouts in halls during inter-hall fifa or counter-strike matches. there isn’t a movie theater on campus, so students often project movies in common rooms or book a lecture hall for movie nights. the nearest cinemas are in kharagpur town (~5 km), but frankly most just download from dc++ hub on lan. weather hacks: kgp weather can be extreme – super hot and humid in autumn, surprisingly chilly in winter (dec-jan nights can drop to ~8°c). so for heat, students get coolers or at least multiple fans; many take

conversations, “mt case” means an empty, hopeless case (from hindi “maat tera”). “phatte” generally refers to the long wooden benches in hall wings where people sit and gossip – so “baithna on the phatte” means chilling and doing nothing productive 😆. you’ll pick up lots of such slang: calling academics “acad”, mugging as “maggu”, brilliant as “machau”, and so on metakgp.org metakgp.org . there are also student-run meme pages and confession pages (like kgp confessions 2.2 on facebook) where campus memes circulate – if you’re active there, you’ll see shared experiences turned into relatable jokes (from mess food memes to cdc placement memes). overall, life at kgp can be as happening or as peaceful as you want. some weekends you might be jam-packed organizing events or attending workshops; other weekends you could be lazing in your room watching movies back-to-back. the campus has a way of providing solace too – late nights on the empty roads, sitting by yourself on the overbridge

chunk 1215 content...
way of providing solace too – late nights on the empty roads, sitting by yourself on the overbridge looking at trains, or star-gazing during power cuts (yes, power cuts happen once in a while, and oddly they become beautiful moments). and of course, the people make all the difference – impromptu birthday celebrations at midnight, wing ‘addas’ (chats) that go till sunrise, these little moments become the big memories. so while iit kgp is intense academically, it also offers a rich campus life – something alumni deeply cherish. timeline insight: in first year, students are exploring all these facets – you’ll see freshers trying out every club, attending every dj night, and gossiping about which hall is best. by final year, nostalgia kicks in – they have their favorite spots and rituals (one last cycle trip to harry’s, one last illu in their hall). first-year questions revolve around “what do i do for fun here?” whereas final-years ask “what should i absolutely do or see before i

“what do i do for fun here?” whereas final-years ask “what should i absolutely do or see before i leave?”. the cycle of discovery and farewell is an essential part of kgp campus life. sources: hall facilities faq hmc.iitkgp.ac.in ; hmc maintenance guidelines hmc.iitkgp.ac.in ; student remarks on mess food reddit.com reddit.com ; metakgp lingo glossary metakgp.org reddit.com placements & internships q: how important is cgpa for placements? is there a cutoff? a: cgpa is quite important at least for the initial stage of campus placements – primarily because many companies use a cgpa cutoff to shortlist students for tests/interviews. the common cutoff at iit kgp for coveted roles is around 7.0 to 8.0 cgpa. in fact, a lot of “dream” companies (high-paying finance, consulting, software firms) set 8.0 or 8.5 as minimum eligible cgpa reddit.com . so having below 7 means you could be ineligible for a majority of companies on day 1/2. that said, there are also plenty of companies (especially in

chunk 1217 content...
a majority of companies on day 1/2. that said, there are also plenty of companies (especially in core engineering, some psus, or startups) that are fine with 6.0 or have no cutoff if you pass their test. but to maximize chances, students aim to keep cgpa ≥ 7.5 by placement season. an iitkgp alum on reddit put it bluntly: “good cgpa will increase your chances of a good job. the main reason is a lot of good companies have 8+ cutoff” reddit.com . another commenter added that for ms/mba admissions too, a high cgpa strengthens your profile reddit.com . so the consensus: try to stay above ~8.0 if possible. however, cgpa alone doesn’t guarantee a job – skills, interviews and luck play a huge role. plenty of 9-pointers struggle with interviews while some 7-pointer with great coding skills lands a top offer. but as a safety, hitting that cutoff is key to just get your foot in the door. also, companies sometimes use cgpa to settle ties – e.g. if two candidates perform equally well, the one with

sometimes use cgpa to settle ties – e.g. if two candidates perform equally well, the one with higher cg may get preference reddit.com reddit.com . there are exceptions: if you have stellar projects or relevant experience, a slightly lower cgpa might be overlooked (some companies allow a few lower-cgpa candidates if recommended by profs or through resume exception). but that’s not common. so, think of cgpa as the first filter – beyond that, your preparation matters more. students often ask: “should i be a maggu and get 9+ or focus on other things?” – the typical advice is balance it. a 9+ (nehli/dassi cg) is excellent but diminishing returns after 8 – because most cutoffs are below 9. it’s better to be ~8 and also have strong projects/internships, than to be 9.5 with nothing else, as companies also look for well-rounded cvs. in short: maintain cgpa above 7.5 or 8 to keep doors open reddit.com , but don’t obsess beyond that – use remaining time to build skills, because after the

chunk 1219 content...
reddit.com , but don’t obsess beyond that – use remaining time to build skills, because after the shortlist, cgpa doesn’t help you answer coding problems or case interviews. and importantly, don’t lose hope if your cgpa is low – every year people with 6-ish cgs get decent offers by targeting the right companies and excelling in the tests. some roles (like pure software coding tests) care more about your coding ability than cg. also, campus placement is not the only route – off-campus opportunities exist where cgpa matters even less. so a low cgpa might make your on-campus journey bumpier, but it’s not the end of the road. as one senior said, “a low cgpa does not reduce your chances of earning well later in life. but to get the max benefit of an iit tag, a good cgpa helps a lot initially.” reddit.com . that nicely sums it up. q: how can i prepare for and land a good internship (ppo)? a: internships (typically done in the summer after 3rd year for b.techs) are crucial because many lead

chunk 1220 content...
internships (typically done in the summer after 3rd year for b.techs) are crucial because many lead to ppos (pre-placement offers) – a full-time job offer before final year. the process at kgp is coordinated by the career development centre (cdc). preparation depends on the field you’re targeting: for software/analytics roles: start practicing competitive programming and data structures from 2nd year itself. many big tech companies (google, microsoft, etc.) and quant firms give coding tests (on hackerrank, etc.) as the first round for internship hiring. aim to be comfortable with algorithms (dp, graph, trees) by your fifth semester. participate in contests (codechef, codeforces) to sharpen speed wiki.metakgp.org . also, do projects or online courses in areas of interest (machine learning, web dev, etc.) – they strengthen your resume and give talking points in interviews. a typical timeline: in pre-final year august-september, companies conduct internship tests on campus. if you clear

chunk 1221 content...
in pre-final year august-september, companies conduct internship tests on campus. if you clear the test, you’ll have 1-2 interviews focusing on coding and sometimes core subjects. prepare your resume story well – you should be able to explain any project or skill you listed (e.g. if you put c++, be ready for oop concepts questions wiki.metakgp.org ). if you get an internship, make the most of those 8 weeks – show enthusiasm, learn fast, and network. for ppo, performance during the internship is key: meet your deadlines, ask for feedback, and maybe even go beyond assigned work to show initiative. many ppos are decided by comparison – if you’re in the top x% of interns, you’ll likely get one. keep in touch with your manager/mentor’s expectations. also, small but vital: follow the company culture, be punctual even in the virtual setup, and gel with the team (they often assess cultural fit too for ppo). for core engineering internships: companies like schlumberger, tata steel, exxon,

fit too for ppo). for core engineering internships: companies like schlumberger, tata steel, exxon, etc., will test your core subject knowledge. so revise your department courses (for mech: thermodynamics, som; for elec: circuits, signals; etc.). they may also have an aptitude test. focus on any practical experience – if you did a prof’s research project or a good lab project, highlight that. core interviews often involve problem-solving (“draw a stress-strain curve and explain”, “how to improve efficiency of a process” etc.). also, some core companies pick interns through department rank/gpa directly or through professors’ recommendations (e.g., some r&d internships). so doing well in core courses and building rapport with faculty can help. for finance/consulting internships: these are fewer in number, but some consult firms (mckinsey, bcg) and finance roles come for internships. prep would involve practicing case interviews (for consulting) – form a “case group” with peers and drill

involve practicing case interviews (for consulting) – form a “case group” with peers and drill cases regularly wiki.metakgp.org wiki.metakgp.org . for finance, get your basics of corporate finance, accounting, and maybe do cfa level 1 if very keen (though not mandatory). also, excel at aptitude tests – consulting and analytics firms put heavy weight on quantitative, verbal, logical reasoning tests. there are resources like “case in point” and company-specific case books wiki.metakgp.org . puzzle questions are common too (especially in quant finance interviews). resume building: second-year summer is a great time to do something – a research internship (through programs like mitacs, daad) or a project under an iit prof, or even a personal project/startup. this gives you solid content on your cv. join relevant technical clubs or societies – e.g., robotics, data science, finance club – and participate in competitions. any achievement (say, won a hackathon, or among top 50 in kaggle

chunk 1224 content...
– and participate in competitions. any achievement (say, won a hackathon, or among top 50 in kaggle contest, or position of responsibility in a club) adds weight. leadership or teamwork experiences are valued by many firms – if you organized spring fest event or were a hall captain, mention it (consulting hr rounds often delve into such “tell me a time you led a team” questions wiki.metakgp.org ). cdc resources: use the resources the institute provides. the cdc releases an internship schedule and often conducts soft-skill sessions. they may also share practice tests from past years. older students sometimes compile a question bank of interview questions they faced (you can find such reports on metakgp or via seniors). networking: though campus internship hiring is structured, networking can help if you’re seeking something off-campus. leverage alumni on linkedin – kgp alumni are generally helpful if you reach out properly. if you’re interested in a niche field or a non-core internship

chunk 1225 content...
helpful if you reach out properly. if you’re interested in a niche field or a non-core internship (say, ui/ux design or policy), you might have to hunt it down yourself by emailing or linkedin, since cdc mainly brings conventional profiles. once you secure an internship, work diligently. for ppo, there’s often an end-evaluation – some companies even have a mini review or final project presentation. treat the internship as a 2-month interview. also, clarify with hr early on if they offer ppos and the criteria (some companies hire interns without intention of ppo; others explicitly say ppos will be given to x%). this helps manage expectations. if you don’t get a third-year summer internship through campus, don’t freak out. many students find alternatives: doing a project under a professor (which can convert into a research publication or strong reco), or internships in autumn semester (some companies offer 6-month internships in final year which often result in ppos). the key is to use

companies offer 6-month internships in final year which often result in ppos). the key is to use that time meaningfully, so you still have something to show for it in placement interviews. in summary, to land a good internship: start early with skill prep, tailor your preparation to target sectors, build a solid resume, and then practice tests and interviews. and after landing it, treat the internship like a long interview to snag the ppo. pre-final year is naturally anxiety-ridden, but as seniors often reassure juniors, “don’t compare offers on day 1; internships and ppos often work out differently for everyone. trust the process and keep improving yourself.” the pattern observed is that those who put steady effort (coding practice, case prep, etc.) throughout 3rd year tend to fare better than those who panic late. so start prepping in summer of 2nd year or beginning of 3rd – you’ll thank yourself when the tests hit. q: how do campus placements work and how should i prepare? a: final

yourself when the tests hit. q: how do campus placements work and how should i prepare? a: final year campus placements at iit kgp are an orchestrated frenzy, especially in december (the placement month). here’s how it works and what you should do: structure of placement season: the season is divided into “days” (day 1, day 2, … day 5, etc. – not literal consecutive days, but clusters of companies in order of priority). day 1 (often 1st december) has the most sought-after companies – top international offers, big tech (google, microsoft), high-end finance (quant firms), consults (mckinsey), etc. multiple companies run processes in parallel slots. students may hold multiple shortlists and have to prioritize which interviews to attend if they clash. once you get an offer, you’re out of the process (you generally only get to accept one offer). the cdc’s policy is usually “one student, one job offer” to maximize placements. so people often aim high initially but also have backup options

job offer” to maximize placements. so people often aim high initially but also have backup options in mind for later days. shortlisting: prior to december, companies ask for resumes. they shortlist based on cgpa cutoffs, skills, etc. ensure your resume is crisp, factual, and well-formatted – the cdc usually enforces a standard one-page resume format. get your resume reviewed by seniors or through cdc’s resume workshops (they often invite alumni to critique resumes). common advice: quantify achievements (e.g. “improved algorithm efficiency by 30%” instead of just “did project on x”). also, be ready to produce proof of anything on your resume if asked (certificates, etc., though not often asked, the honor code applies). tests and interviews: most companies (except some core) will have an aptitude or technical test either just before placements or on the placement day. for tech roles, expect coding tests (hackerrank style) wiki.metakgp.org . for analytics, expect quantitative aptitude

chunk 1229 content...
coding tests (hackerrank style) wiki.metakgp.org . for analytics, expect quantitative aptitude and maybe a bit of coding. consulting will have problem-solving or caselets. there might also be group discussions for some companies (though these have reduced in recent years). if you clear tests, you go through multiple interview rounds – typically 2-4 rounds. e.g., a software company might have 2 technical rounds (coding, cs concepts) and 1 hr round wiki.metakgp.org wiki.metakgp.org . consulting might have 2 case interviews + 1 hr. interviews can start from midnight of day 1 and continue overnight – yes, it’s crazy but true! it’s not uncommon to see people coming out of an interview at 3 am and going into another at 6 am. prepare for endurance – sleep well before day 1, and keep some snacks/energy bars with you. preparation strategy: it depends on sector (similar to internship prep, but deeper): technical (software/it): along with coding practice, revise core cs subjects (os, dbms,

deeper): technical (software/it): along with coding practice, revise core cs subjects (os, dbms, networks, oop) as interviewers often quiz on these wiki.metakgp.org wiki.metakgp.org . have at least 2 strong projects and be ready to discuss them in depth (they may ask why you chose a certain tech, challenges faced, etc.). also, practice explaining your solutions out loud on a whiteboard – communication during coding interviews is important. core engineering: brush up fundamental theory and any practical training you did. they may ask you to solve simple technical problems on the spot or even do a bit of coding (some core companies now expect basic programming knowledge too). be prepared for hr questions like “why this sector, not it?” if you have a decent cg (they sometimes doubt if you’ll jump to it later). data science/analytics: practice puzzles, basic stats, maybe knowledge of tools like sql, python, r. some companies have a case study or a take-home data analysis task.

of tools like sql, python, r. some companies have a case study or a take-home data analysis task. consulting/finance: by final year, if you’re aiming these, you should have done dozens of case interview practices. also expect guesstimates (market sizing questions) and behavioral questions like “tell me a time you showed leadership” wiki.metakgp.org . for finance, know current market news, basic valuation concepts, etc. group tasks: a few companies (like some product management or strategic roles) might do a group activity or case discussion to shortlist. general tip for gd: come across as logical and cooperative, not aggressive. make 2-3 quality points, let others speak too, and if possible, summarize at the end. they’re gauging communication and teamwork. placements resources: use the placement preparation resources compiled by students wiki.metakgp.org . for instance, metakgp wiki has sector-wise guides with common interview questions, and seniors often share their interview

chunk 1232 content...
has sector-wise guides with common interview questions, and seniors often share their interview experiences which are super helpful (they might tell exactly what company x asked them last year – often companies repeat patterns). also attend the cdc training sessions and mock interviews if provided. during placements: stay organized. keep multiple copies of your resume printed (some interviewers like a hard copy). dress in formal attire for interviews. more importantly, stay calm and positive. the environment is high-pressure – some friends might get offers while you’re still waiting, but don’t let that rattle you. the cdc office often posts results in real-time, and cheers erupt when someone gets placed. remember, it’s not a direct reflection of worth – sometimes a single test question or interviewer mood can make or break an offer. so if you face a rejection, bounce back for the next one. many students end up getting placed on later days in roles they find satisfying, even if day 1

one. many students end up getting placed on later days in roles they find satisfying, even if day 1 didn’t go well. backup plans: despite best efforts, a handful of students might not have an offer by end of campus process. the institute usually keeps inviting more companies until almost everyone is placed. it’s useful to also apply off-campus as a backup if you’re in a niche field. but historically, iit kgp sees 90%+ placement each year within the placement season linkedin.com . so trust the process, and leverage the alumni network if needed for off-campus leads. in essence, placement prep is a marathon that starts ideally in 3rd year and intensifies in final year. by systematically preparing for your target domain (coding practice, case prep, core review), and presenting yourself well on paper and in person, you significantly boost your chances. and once in the interview, confidence and clarity are key – speak honestly about your experiences, solve problems aloud, and show eagerness

chunk 1234 content...
clarity are key – speak honestly about your experiences, solve problems aloud, and show eagerness to learn. hr interviews will certainly ask common questions (“tell me about yourself”, “why do you want to join us?”, “strengths/weaknesses” wiki.metakgp.org ), so prepare those answers with examples. also be ready for oddballs like “where do you see yourself in 5 years?” or “discuss a failure” wiki.metakgp.org – they’re checking your self-awareness. finally, placement time, though stressful, is a once-in-a-lifetime experience – the camaraderie of batchmates, the collective anxiety and celebrations, ordering midnight snacks while waiting for results – it’s a bonding experience. support your friends, share prep materials, and celebrate every offer (regardless of big or small company) because each is hard-earned. as the saying goes, “placement ho jaaye, phir full masti!” (once placements are done, it’s all fun) – kgp final-years definitely party hard after that last interview is over! q:

done, it’s all fun) – kgp final-years definitely party hard after that last interview is over! q: how do students deal with placement pressure and failures? a: the pressure is real – by final year, a kind of “placement anxiety” sets in for many. students cope in different ways. the campus’s support systems include the counseling centre (now rebranded as sarth – support, acceptance, resilience, therapy & healing instagram.com ) which is available if someone is feeling extremely low. the student welfare group and mentorship networks also check on students. on a peer level, batchmates become each other’s support – people form groups to study together, do mock interviews for each other, and importantly, to remind each other to take breaks. you’ll see groups going for a late-night cycle run or a movie in the hall common room after a long day of prep, just to de-stress. it’s important to remember that almost everyone faces rejections in placements. it’s not uncommon to hear someone say, “i

that almost everyone faces rejections in placements. it’s not uncommon to hear someone say, “i got rejected in 10 interviews before the 11th company clicked.” hearing ‘no’ repeatedly can dent confidence, but seniors advise to view each interview as a learning experience – take a moment to note what questions stumped you, improve on them, and move on to the next opportunity. one kgpian wrote a blog after placements saying he was grateful for rejections because they taught him to persevere and not take success for granted reddit.com . there’s also a strong culture of not disclosing salaries/offers publicly (cdc actually requests students to avoid sharing offer details widely during the process) – this helps reduce unhealthy comparison. you’ll of course know who got which company, but kgpians generally congratulate and move on, focusing on their own race. if you find yourself without an offer while friends have one, it’s natural to feel demoralized, but keep perspective – in a few

an offer while friends have one, it’s natural to feel demoralized, but keep perspective – in a few months, everyone will be in different places and life isn’t a sprint. many alumni say that in hindsight, that one job or day 1 selection mattered less in the long run. that said, in the immediate term, do lean on friends and family if you’re stressed. talk it out – sometimes a pep talk from a close friend or a mentor (maybe an alum who’s been through it) can recharge you. also, maintain some routine – eat meals, get some sleep, maybe a bit of exercise – it’s easy to lose that during placement prep, but it helps keep your mind sharp and mood stable. the cdc sometime arranges quick meditation or counseling sessions in peak time – those can help if you’re into it. if you do end up unplaced by end of december, note that hiring isn’t over. companies keep coming in january, and even after graduation one can use the iit alumni network to find roles. every year, a few people secure off-campus

chunk 1238 content...
one can use the iit alumni network to find roles. every year, a few people secure off-campus offers after the main season – nothing shameful about that. the key is resilience. iitians are high achievers who often face true rejection only in placement time – it can be humbling, but also character-building. as one alum advised on reddit to a worried junior: “placement time will test you, but remember even if you stumble initially, eventually something will work out as long as you keep trying. no one stays jobless forever – kgp teaches you to fight on.” this community support and shared struggle indeed helps; the phrase “cg padta hai” (cgpa matters) turns into “cpr padta hai” (contacts, persistence, and resilience matter) – a tongue-in-cheek saying among final years. in conclusion, placement prep is about knowledge prep and mental prep. start early, practice hard, and also mentally gear up for a rollercoaster. utilize institute resources, seniors’ guidance, and peer support. when it’s

everyone else seems ahead of me.” this “am i behind?” syndrome can hit in different ways: a coder sees peers winning contests and feels inadequate, or someone in 3rd year sees friends getting internships and panics about their own future. one reassurance: everyone has their own pace and path. iitkgp’s culture, while competitive, also has a strong ethos of “co-operating to compete”. you’ll find study groups where seniors freely share notes and “fundas” to juniors, friends pull each other up through tough exams. so, a good way to combat feeling behind is to reach out and talk – whether to a friend, a senior mentor, or a counsellor. often, you’ll realize others are facing similar struggles. a candid confession on kgp confessions (the anonymous fb page) about feeling lost might get dozens of supportive comments from fellow students who relate and offer advice. the institute has a counseling centre (sarth) with professional counsellors. they offer one-on-one counseling sessions

counseling centre (sarth) with professional counsellors. they offer one-on-one counseling sessions confidentially. in recent years, iitkgp administration has acknowledged student stress issues – even the branch change removal was aimed at reducing academic pressure that led to depression for some timesofindia.indiatimes.com . if you notice yourself or a friend “feeling aloof, depressed, or behaving abnormally”, the hall wardens and counsellors encourage reaching out early hmc.iitkgp.ac.in hmc.iitkgp.ac.in . there’s also an initiative where trained student volunteers (spark representatives) in each hall keep an eye out and lend a friendly ear if someone seems to be isolating or overly down. don’t ever hesitate to seek help – it’s not stigmatized like it used to be; in fact, kgp students have become quite open about discussing mental health. burnout (extreme exhaustion from overwork) often hits during peak academic weeks or while juggling too many activities. the remedy is literally to

hits during peak academic weeks or while juggling too many activities. the remedy is literally to give yourself a break. kgpians have a term “luchi” (means to slack off intentionally). sometimes doing a bit of luchi – like taking one weekend off completely to go to kolkata or puri with friends, or just to sleep and watch movies – can recharge you enough to come back more productive. it’s important to recognize signs of burnout: inability to concentrate, feeling cynical about activities you used to enjoy, physical fatigue. when that happens, step back and prioritize. you can’t do everything; maybe drop one elective or reduce club hours if academics are overwhelming – that’s okay. many seniors recount how they had to find a balance after trying to “do it all” and crashing. for example, a confession #6819 went viral where a student shared: he failed a subject, quit all clubs thinking they were to blame, yet still got low grades next term despite 100% class attendance – realizing that

were to blame, yet still got low grades next term despite 100% class attendance – realizing that leaving hobbies didn’t magically fix academics facebook.com . the lesson was to maintain a healthy mix and not scapegoat extracurriculars entirely for academic dips (instead, a structured approach to studies was needed). the student then sought support and bounced back. that story resonated because a lot of kgpians realize that completely isolating yourself just to study can backfire – it leads to loneliness and more burnout. isolation and homesickness: kgp is far for many (geographically and culturally). in first year, homesickness or trouble making friends can cause isolation. the halls try to mitigate this by having freshers’ socials, inductions, and pairing juniors with seniors (like “wing mentors”). if you feel alone, try joining one of the many clubs – bonding over a shared interest (music, coding, literary, sports) is the easiest way to find your tribe. also, keep in touch with

(music, coding, literary, sports) is the easiest way to find your tribe. also, keep in touch with family and old friends; a sunday video call home or chatting with school friends can emotionally ground you. iitkgp’s campus can feel overwhelming, but it’s also a community – you might be surprised how approaching a friendly senior or classmate to say “i’m kinda struggling with this, could you help?” will be met with empathy. the culture is not cutthroat; seniors often adopt juniors like siblings. exam anxiety: the exam schedule at kgp is relentless – frequent quizzes, midsems, endsems. if you find anxiety crippling you (unable to sleep before exams, or panic during tests), there are a few strategies: (1) be prepared: many fear comes from uncertainty, so having a study plan and doing mock questions helps confidence. (2) mindfulness techniques: some students use deep breathing, short meditation, or listening to music to calm nerves before an exam. halls sometimes organize yoga or

meditation, or listening to music to calm nerves before an exam. halls sometimes organize yoga or meditation sessions if interest is there. (3) perspective: remind yourself one exam won’t define everything – worst-case you get an f, you can retake; life goes on. that mental reassurance can defang the exam’s terror. seniors often share stories of their worst screw-ups to make juniors feel better. for instance, hearing that your hall’s brightest star once blanked an entire quiz and still survived the course helps you see that a low grade isn’t the end. competition vs collaboration: it’s easy to feel inadequate when surrounded by toppers. a classic hostel scenario: you’re struggling with an assignment while your roommate already finished a more advanced project – can be demotivating. but instead of withdrawing, collaborate. kgp’s culture has evolved to more group study and collective problem solving. forming study circles not only helps academically but combats the feeling of facing

gurudwara on campus) which some students visit for peace of mind. when things get very tough: unfortunately, iits have seen tragedies due to mental health issues. kgp is no exception. it’s important to watch out for friends – if someone withdraws completely, stops attending classes, or shows extreme stress signals, encourage them to seek help and let the authorities know if needed. the institute has instructed that any signs of severe depression in a hall mate should be urgently reported to hall presidents or counselors hmc.iitkgp.ac.in . it’s always better to have professionals intervene early than to regret not speaking up. the community has become more vigilant after past incidents. on a positive note, many alumni reflect that their lowest points at iit kgp became turning points – teaching them resilience. one senior wrote: “i failed a course and felt i didn’t deserve to be here. but bouncing back from that, i realized failure isn’t fatal. iit taught me to fail, learn, and keep

but bouncing back from that, i realized failure isn’t fatal. iit taught me to fail, learn, and keep moving.” reddit.com reddit.com . this resilience is perhaps one of the biggest takeaways of the iit journey. as cliche as it sounds, “when the going gets tough, the tough get going”. and at iit kgp, you’ll find that you’re tougher than you think, especially with 12,000 peers by your side and a robust support system. so, if you’re feeling overwhelmed, please remember: pause, breathe, reach out (to friends, to mentors, or to counselors who are literally there for this), and break the problem into parts. whether it’s one difficult course or a general sense of being lost, there are concrete steps and people willing to help. you’re part of the kgp family – and “once a kgpian, always a kgpian”, we take care of our own reddit.com . q: i feel i’m not as good as others – some peers are achieving so much. how do i stay motivated without comparing? a: this is a classic impostor syndrome scenario.

much. how do i stay motivated without comparing? a: this is a classic impostor syndrome scenario. in a batch of extremely bright students, it’s easy to feel “i’m average, others are stars”. motivation can dip when you start comparing yourself relentlessly – like seeing someone bag a big scholarship or build a startup, and wondering if you’re doing anything worthwhile. the first step is to set your own goals distinct from others’. iit offers myriad paths – not everyone needs to be a dean’s list scholar or a coding champ or a cultural superstar. you might choose a moderate path in acads but dive deep into say photography, and that’s equally valid. one piece of advice seniors give is: find your “one thing” that gives you joy or meaning here. it could be a hobby, a club, a sport, or an academic topic you love – something that makes you want to get out of bed. it anchors you and builds confidence. for instance, maybe you’re not topping classes, but you love painting – joining fine arts

chunk 1250 content...
for instance, maybe you’re not topping classes, but you love painting – joining fine arts society and contributing to spring fest rangoli gives you a sense of accomplishment that balances academic middling performance. also, realize that a lot of people showcase their best, hiding their struggles. the coder who won a hackathon might be failing at maintaining relationships; the class topper might be battling health issues. everyone has their battles. so don’t measure your worth with someone else’s measuring tape. if you find yourself demotivated, take small steps: complete a minor task and celebrate it. break big goals (like improving cgpa or cracking gate/cat) into smaller milestones so you can see progress and not lose heart. many students use visual reminders for motivation – quotes on their wall, or an image of their role model. kgp dorm rooms often have motivational quotes plastered (from apj abdul kalam, elon musk, to funny memes like “dar ke aage jeet hai”). it might sound

chunk 1251 content...
(from apj abdul kalam, elon musk, to funny memes like “dar ke aage jeet hai”). it might sound cheesy, but in low moments, reading “never give up” on your wall can give a tiny push. peers can also be motivators rather than sources of envy if you change the perspective: instead of “i’m jealous they achieved x”, think “if they can, i can try too – maybe i’ll ask them how they did it.” in kgp, seniors especially love to share how they prepared for gre or how they built a project. use that. convert comparison into inspiration: learn from others’ success stories without thinking it diminishes yours. kgp also has frequent talks by alumni and industry leaders (under initiatives like kgp konnexion or dept. seminars). attending those can light a spark – hearing an alumnus who went through the same halls and achieved great things often leaves students feeling “if they could slog and make it, so can i.” for example, sundar pichai (google’s ceo) is a kgp alum – when he visited campus, students

can i.” for example, sundar pichai (google’s ceo) is a kgp alum – when he visited campus, students were hugely inspired by his journey and humble roots. ultimately, motivation has to come from within – iit will give you challenges that external pep talks can’t sustain you through. one trick is to remember why you’re here in the first place. think back to the effort you put in to clear jee and the dreams you had when joining iit. that fire got you this far; it can keep you going. maybe your goals have evolved (you might not want to be an engineer but a writer now – that’s okay), then align your efforts to your new passion and pursue it wholeheartedly (iitkgp has literature, dramatics, entrepreneurship avenues too). define success on your own terms: for one person it’s a 9+ cg and research papers; for another it might be building a crazy car in sae team or organizing an unforgettable spring fest. both are achievements. reward yourself for small wins – finished that project? treat

steel. if all else fails, talk to an elder or faculty you trust – sometimes a simple encouraging line from a mentor can reignite your drive. professors here, despite the strict exterior, have guided many depressed students back on track by putting things in perspective (they’ve seen generations of students and can often calmly assure you that you’re doing fine). in summary: stop the toxic comparisons, set personal goals, take inspiration instead of envy, and remind yourself of the bigger picture. celebrate small wins and seek support when needed. motivation at iit is a marathon, not a sprint – you have to refill your tank periodically. do things that make you happy alongside things that are necessary. a happy, balanced student is naturally more motivated. iit kharagpur is challenging, but it’s also where you’ll forge lifelong friendships and memories – those are a source of strength too. whenever demotivation hits, plug into the kgp community and spirit; you’ll find the collective

too. whenever demotivation hits, plug into the kgp community and spirit; you’ll find the collective energy often lifts you right back up. q: what support does iit kgp provide for mental health and difficult times? a: iit kharagpur has been increasing its support infrastructure for student wellness in recent years. the primary avenue is the counselling centre (sarth) instagram.com , which has professional counselors available during working hours (and emergency contacts off-hours). they offer private counseling sessions – you can simply email or walk in to schedule one. they’ve also started wellness programs under sarth: stress management workshops, group therapy for academic stress, etc. additionally, each hall of residence has some student mentors and a caring network: for example, wardens and assistant wardens are instructed to be approachable. there is also a system where each hall has a wing representative program – select senior students receive training to identify and help

has a wing representative program – select senior students receive training to identify and help juniors who might be struggling, as noted on the sarth site (counselors visit halls and train these reps) sarth.iitkgp.ac.in . in severe cases, the institute can refer students to the bc roy medical hospital on campus which has psychiatrists. medication (if needed for anxiety/depression) can be prescribed by the campus psychiatric consultant. the confidentiality is maintained so students needn’t fear stigma. for academic difficulties, there is a dean of students’ affairs (dosa) office which can grant semester withdrawal or leave on medical grounds if a student is really in a bad shape and needs a break. this is important: if you’re too overwhelmed and your mental health is at risk, taking a semester off is an option – a tough decision but it has helped some to reset and come back stronger. the student welfare group (swg), a student body under dosa, runs campaigns and peer support. for

the student welfare group (swg), a student body under dosa, runs campaigns and peer support. for instance, they do inductions telling freshers about imposter syndrome and whom to approach in distress. they also organize events like “let’s talk” – open mic nights where students share mental health stories to break stigma. culturally, kgp is becoming more open about mental health. tragic incidents in past years have galvanized both students and faculty to be more vigilant. memorial lectures on mental wellness, interactive sessions with psychologists (sometimes arranged by gymkhana), and initiatives like the “pause and breathe” series on the tsg blog tsgblog.iitkgp.ac.in encourage students to prioritize self-care. when a fellow student sadly passed away in recent memory, the whole campus came together to spread awareness – posters with helpline numbers went up, professors addressed it in classes, urging students to seek help if needed facebook.com . there’s a sense that “we must not lose

urging students to seek help if needed facebook.com . there’s a sense that “we must not lose any more friends”, which drives the support culture. so the support is there, but it’s only useful if students utilize it. the institute can sometimes be bureaucratic, but for personal counseling, they’ve tried to make it student-friendly. for example, sarth’s instagram page posts mental health tips and motivational content in relatable ways instagram.com . the new name “sarth” itself (meaning support) is part of de-stigmatizing – moving away from just “counselling centre” which some saw as taboo. in practice, if you or a friend are going through a rough time – whether it’s clinical depression or just a really bad phase – you can do any of the following: tell your hall warden or hall president (they will keep it discrete and connect you to counseling). or directly approach sarth’s office (behind the hospital) and say you want to talk. even dropping an email to counseling@ can set things

the hospital) and say you want to talk. even dropping an email to counseling@ can set things rolling. if immediate help is needed at an odd hour, the helpline (gfc toll-free) is available hmc.iitkgp.ac.in . one notable support for academic stress: if a student is lagging academically (say multiple backlogs), the academic section and professors sometimes do mentoring interventions. they might assign a faculty mentor to coach the student, or give opportunities like summer quarters to catch up. the key is communicating – if you let your department or professors know you’re struggling due to personal issues, they often give some leeway (like extensions, make-up exams). kgp profs, though strict on surface, do care about students’ well-being when informed. lastly, friends network is an informal but powerful support. every student likely has a friend circle or at least a roommate – and it’s common in kgp culture for friends to perform “counseling” in late-night conversations on rooftops or

in kgp culture for friends to perform “counseling” in late-night conversations on rooftops or over chai. sometimes just that emotional support from a peer who listens can prevent a downward spiral. to sum up, iit kharagpur isn’t just about rigorous academics; it recognizes students are humans with emotional needs. there are official channels (counselors, swg, mentors) and a general campus ethos evolving towards care. if you’re going through a tough time, kgp will not leave you to fight it alone – but you must take the step to reach out. as a community, we’re increasingly saying “it’s okay to not be okay, and help is here.” in the competitive rush, don’t forget: mental health is health. the institute motto “yogah karmasu kaushalam” might mean excellence in work, but it doesn’t preclude taking care of oneself – indeed, you perform best when you’re sound mentally. so use the support, be kind to yourself, and know that your fellow kgpians and the institute have your back. sources: hmc faq

your b.tech skills directly. students choosing this path typically are those who liked their department or want a hands-on engineering career. they often are the ones active in department societies, projects, and might have a core internship. the advantage: you directly start working and gaining experience; the challenge: core sector salaries can be lower initially than, say, software or finance, and growth might require further specialization (like a master’s) later. it/software/analytics job (non-core): a large chunk of students, regardless of branch, end up in the tech industry or data science roles. kgp’s coding culture is strong even among non-cs branches (as noted by a student: “most students irrespective of their core branch learn coding; many study core just enough to maintain cgpa” reddit.com ). this path is popular for its abundance of opportunities and higher packages. even mech/civil folks may join software giants or become data analysts at banks. students choose this for

chunk 1263 content...
folks may join software giants or become data analysts at banks. students choose this for interest in tech or simply because of the lucrative, cosmopolitan career it offers. the institute facilitates this by allowing all branches to sit for such placements (with maybe some coding tests). it’s common to see, say, an electrical dual degree opting for a data scientist role at goldman or a chemical b.tech joining microsoft – and that’s normal at iits now. higher studies (ms/phd abroad or m.tech/phd in india): every year a good number pursue ms or direct phd in the us, europe, etc. typically, these are students who are academically inclined, enjoyed doing projects, or want to specialize in fields like ai, robotics, materials, etc. they spend time in 3rd year doing research internships (e.g. mitacs to canada, daad to germany) or working with kgp professors and maybe publishing papers. come final year, they prepare for gre/toefl for us or gate for indian grad schools if considering m.tech or

year, they prepare for gre/toefl for us or gate for indian grad schools if considering m.tech or direct phd at iits/iisc. one key thing: starting 2022, kgp introduced a “semester away program” and streamlined double major etc., partly to give students more choices akin to higher study exploration timesofindia.indiatimes.com . if you love a subject and can see yourself in r&d or academia, ms/phd is fulfilling – though it’s a longer route (5-6 years phd). students going this way often form a small community – discussing grad applications, getting recos from profs, etc. the graduate studies (apping) club helps with resources for sops. kgpians have cracked top universities regularly (mit, stanford, etc.), often aided by having done strong research during undergrad. also, note: many who initially take jobs eventually go for ms/mba after 1-2 years, so nothing is final; it’s common to see alumni go for grad school later as well. mba: the management bug bites quite a few. some prepare for cat

go for grad school later as well. mba: the management bug bites quite a few. some prepare for cat in final year – balancing it with placements (iitians historically do well in cat, often bagging iim seats). others aim for isb or foreign mbas after some work experience (since those require experience). there’s also vgsom – the mba school within iit kharagpur – some students join it directly after b.tech or a couple of years of work (it’s considered decent, though most prefer iims if they get). why mba? many feel they want to move to managerial roles, or escape technical work, or just because mba offers a career reset into corporate leadership tracks. also, anecdotally, some not-so-interested in coding or core see mba as the route to banks/consultancies that pay well. a “campus myth” is that it’s easier for iitians to crack iim interviews due to the brand and diversity factor (engineers are plenty though, so one needs a high cat percentile). students eyeing cat often start prep in 3rd

are plenty though, so one needs a high cat percentile). students eyeing cat often start prep in 3rd year summer, join test series. the dilemma “job vs mba vs ms” is huge – seniors usually advise: if you’re unsure, maybe work for a couple of years and then decide. working first gives clarity and can strengthen mba applications later. a direct mba is great if you’re certain you want a management career asap. many kgpians do an mba after 2-3 years of job – either in iims (through cat) or abroad (through gmat). civil services (upsc): a small but significant group opt for upsc exams aiming for ias/ips and other government services. some decide this early (in which case they often take humanities breadths, and start reading general studies). others realize later that they want to work in public sector/administration rather than corporate. kgp has produced ias officers – though it’s not super common, maybe a couple of students per batch seriously pursue upsc right after b.tech. they might

common, maybe a couple of students per batch seriously pursue upsc right after b.tech. they might skip placements or take a psu job as a backup and study. the environment for upsc prep: there isn’t a formal coaching on campus, but interested folks sometimes form study groups or take online coaching. the challenge is upsc needs a very different study approach (breadth of humanities knowledge), so it can be daunting coming from engineering. but iitians have succeeded; their strong analytical skills help in csat paper, etc. the key is the passion for serving in govt and patience for possibly multiple attempts. some alumni also join indian engineering services (ies) via the ese exam, particularly civil, electrical, mechanical grads – that’s another govt path for technical roles in railways, cpwd, etc. startups/entrepreneurship: iit kharagpur has a thriving entrepreneurial spirit (it has an entrepreneurship cell (e-cell) and was one of the first iits with a dedicated rajendra mishra school

cell (e-cell) and was one of the first iits with a dedicated rajendra mishra school of entrepreneurship). a number of students either join startups or start their own. campus provides resources like entrepreneurship events, incubation center (step), funding contests, etc. some students choose to not sit for placements and instead work on their startup project full-time after graduation. the culture is supportive: we have the famous example of greyorange (robots startup) founded by kgp alumni who started building it during college. however, doing a startup straight out can be risky – some choose to work a bit to gain experience then found a startup. but a few each year do dive right in – either with campus startup ideas or by joining as early employees in budding startups (instead of mnc jobs). now that startup ecosystem is robust in india, this path is increasingly viable and respected. miscellaneous paths: some go for research jobs (e.g. joining drdo or csir labs), some for teach for

chunk 1269 content...
miscellaneous paths: some go for research jobs (e.g. joining drdo or csir labs), some for teach for india fellowship, some into design (nid, etc.), or civil aviation (pilots) – literally, the sky isn’t the limit! kgp’s flexibility (and alumni network) allows exploration. if one has a unique passion, chances are there’s a way to pursue it after iit. for instance, someone might go into journalism or writing – a notable kgp alum is sandipan deb, former editor of financial express. another might join the indian army (through tgc entry) – it happens. how students decide: it often boils down to personal interest + perceived roi. many do placements first even if considering higher studies, to have a safety net. some with strong research inclination choose ms/phd directly, since going into a job might drift them away from academia. often, students in dual degree or with research exposure lean towards ms/phd. those inclined towards business or leadership often try for mba or consult jobs.

chunk 1270 content...
towards ms/phd. those inclined towards business or leadership often try for mba or consult jobs. financial considerations matter too: an overseas ms can be expensive, so students factor in scholarship chances or family support. mba in iim is costly but short (2 years) and often loans are banked on future salary. peers and seniors influence a lot. if someone’s mentor figure went to, say, stanford ms and did great, the junior might be inspired to follow. the placement vs higher studies divide is roughly 70:30 at kgp, with the majority sitting for jobs and a significant minority applying abroad or taking gate. a few attempt everything (placements, cat, gre all at once) to keep options open – though that’s quite stressful. one trend: many who go to jobs (especially it/consulting) consider doing an mba after a few years. it’s almost a planned trajectory: work 2-3 years -> mba -> possibly switch career track. some companies even sponsor further studies after 2 years. for phd, some do b.tech

career track. some companies even sponsor further studies after 2 years. for phd, some do b.tech -> phd directly (especially if they secure admits to top programs with fellowship). others do ms first. regrets or advice from alumni: often heard: “don’t go for higher studies just to escape placements or because everyone’s doing it – do it only if you genuinely like the field.” similarly, “don’t do mba just for the heck of it; work a bit to know if you really need it.” there are regrets like alumni saying they rushed into an ms without clarity and then switched to industry anyway, or those who took a job under peer pressure and later wished they’d followed their passion for civil services or research sooner. but most find their way eventually. the good thing is an iit kgp degree is respected and gives some leeway to switch paths later as well. to help final-year students, iit kgp’s career development cell and departments often invite alumni for career talks. there’s also a lot of

career development cell and departments often invite alumni for career talks. there’s also a lot of informal gyaan-sharing: hall common rooms see seniors advising juniors on what gre score needed for which unis, or how an mba after 2 years in corporate was the best decision they made, etc. in short, by final year, iit kgp students diverge into diverse lanes – some into technical careers, some into further studies, some into completely different domains. the campus environment tries to facilitate all: you have coding contests and gate coaching sessions, you have mba prep groups and upsc aspirants reading the hindu. it’s a bit of a buffet of career options, and each student loads their plate according to taste. timeline note: typically, at the start of 4th year, many are undecided. by mid 4th year, decisions firm up: those applying abroad will be knee-deep in applications (deadlines around nov/dec), those doing cat will take it in nov, those placement-bound will gear up for december

nov/dec), those doing cat will take it in nov, those placement-bound will gear up for december interviews. it’s a hectic time where some are juggling multiple processes (e.g. applying abroad and sitting for placements as backup). but come march of final year, most have clarity and a plan in hand – be it an admit, an offer, or a planned gap year for upsc. and a kgp quip: “at the end, sab moh maya hai” – meaning, don’t sweat it too much because many paths can lead to success. as an alumnus beautifully put it: “whether you join a big firm, a startup, go to iim or mit or become a civil servant – in five years out of kgp, you’ll find kgpians in all those places. so whatever path you choose, you won’t be alone, the kgp network and spirit follows.” q: how do i decide if i should do a masters/phd or take a job? a: this is very individual, but some guiding questions: do you love a specific technical subject and enjoy research/problem-solving for its own sake? if yes, higher studies might

chunk 1274 content...
technical subject and enjoy research/problem-solving for its own sake? if yes, higher studies might fulfill you (and lead to r&d careers, academia, or specialized roles). for example, if you found yourself reading extra papers in machine learning beyond class, or tinkering in the lab happily, that’s a sign you might enjoy grad school. on the other hand, if you’re more excited by applying skills in real-world projects, working in industry teams, or you value financial independence sooner, a job might be better to start with. sometimes it’s not either/or: as mentioned, many work then do masters (especially common in computer science – lots of iitians go to us for ms after 1-2 years of working, since us unis value experience). consider opportunity cost: if you have a great job offer in hand versus an admit to a decent (not top) university, weigh the outcomes. also consider field: certain fields (like cutting-edge ai, semiconductor design, theoretical physics) almost require a masters/phd

chunk 1275 content...
(like cutting-edge ai, semiconductor design, theoretical physics) almost require a masters/phd to progress. others (like software development, finance) value practical experience more and an ms might not be necessary unless from a top school. financially, masters abroad involves expense, but many get scholarships or loans knowing payback is possible with us/eu salaries. phds typically are funded (you get a stipend). if you’re from a modest family background, you might feel pressure to earn early – perhaps taking the job first is pragmatic, and maybe your employer might even sponsor grad school later. talk to mentors: kgp profs can give honest input on your aptitude for research. alumni in various fields can share how life is in academia vs corporate. sometimes students romanticize phd and find it’s slogging over a narrow problem for 5 years – which can be frustrating if they weren’t truly into it. conversely, some jump to a job and find it monotonous, wishing for the academic freedom

into it. conversely, some jump to a job and find it monotonous, wishing for the academic freedom of an ms. one middle ground: higher studies in management or interdisciplinary fields. for instance, some go for masters in management or public policy if they want non-tech education. or an interdisciplinary masters like design, economics, etc., if that’s where interest lies. iit kgp actually encourages interdisciplinary “switchovers” now (they mentioned making dual degree and ms students eligible for interdisciplinary dual degrees timesofindia.indiatimes.com ). essentially, the institute acknowledges students may discover new interests. in making the decision, reflect on your long-term vision. if you see yourself wanting to lead engineering teams or be a chief engineer/scientist, a masters/phd is valuable. if you see yourself migrating to broader management or entrepreneurship, an immediate job or an mba might make more sense than a technical grad degree. one can also look at immediate

chunk 1277 content...
job or an mba might make more sense than a technical grad degree. one can also look at immediate next 2-3 year happiness: will you be happier studying and student-life a bit longer, or are you itching to get out of the academic grind and start something new in a job? there’s no universally right answer. a relevant piece of alumni wisdom: “don’t go for ms just because others are or because you think job prospects are bleak – go because you want to learn more in that field.” similarly, “don’t do a job just due to pressure – if you’re passionate about research, a mediocre job will not satisfy you.” also, remember, nowadays careers can be flexible. it’s possible to do a job for a few years and then do a phd (some iitians have done that, even switching fields). or do a masters and later go into an mba or industry. so whatever you choose is not irreversible. it’s more about what fits you now and sets you on a trajectory you’re excited about. q: do many iit kgp grads go for competitive exams

sets you on a trajectory you’re excited about. q: do many iit kgp grads go for competitive exams like gate, cat, gre? a: yes, quite a number do. some stats in broad terms: a significant portion (maybe 15-20%) appear for gate in final year – either to pursue m.tech/phd in iits/iisc or for psu (public sector unit) jobs since many psus hire through gate. within certain departments, gate is very popular (e.g., a lot of civil engineering students aim for gate to join government organizations). kgp provides gate coaching sessions informally via student groups or seniors sharing materials. many start gate prep in 3rd year itself, solving previous papers, etc. for cat (mba entrance), a decent chunk try – perhaps 10-15% seriously, with others as a backup. historically, iitians dominate in cat percentiles. at kgp, you’ll find study groups for cat forming, and coaching materials floating around (some enroll in time/ims weekend classes in kolkata or online). the advantage is quant section is

(some enroll in time/ims weekend classes in kolkata or online). the advantage is quant section is easier for engineers, but english/verbal needs practice for some. those who crack cat often land in iim abc or other top iims – each year perhaps 30-40 students from kgp join iims. some also take gmat for isb or abroad. for gre, many (especially in cs, ee, etc.) take it if aiming for ms. gre prep is usually straightforward for iitians (just need to mug vocab and practice analytical writing). it’s taken typically in summer before final year. ielts/toefl as well for english proficiency. over the years, applying abroad has remained steady – maybe 10-15% of a batch (some departments more, some less). then there’s upsc (ias) as discussed – a smaller group, but yes some do and have succeeded. also ies for engineering services, which is like gate-level tech plus gs; a handful go for that especially if interested in government engineering roles. so, you’ll definitely see many peers preparing for

if interested in government engineering roles. so, you’ll definitely see many peers preparing for one exam or the other. the joke is final year students are either preparing for placements, or gre, or cat, or gate – everyone’s preparing for something! and some extreme ones prepare for all (though that usually dilutes effectiveness). how do they balance? some plan sequentially (e.g., attempt cat in nov, then focus on placements in dec if cat doesn’t pan out, etc.). the academic load in final year is lighter typically (especially for b.tech, not dual), so there’s some time for exam prep. in hall life, you might find one wing where one guy is coding for placements, next room guy reading “indian polity by laxmikanth” for upsc, another memorizing barron’s wordlist for gre. it’s a diverse environment. at the end of the day, iit kgp produces not just engineers but administrators, researchers, managers, entrepreneurs. the frequently asked career questions revolve around weighing these options

chunk 1281 content...
entrepreneurs. the frequently asked career questions revolve around weighing these options and seeking guidance from those who’ve walked the paths. as a result, student faqs in this realm often get answered by seniors/alumni sharing their own story – which is incredibly valuable, adding human perspective beyond generic advice. kgp’s alumni network (including on linkedin, quora, reddit) is a treasure trove where many have written about “why i chose a phd over a job” or “how i prepared for cat alongside studies”, etc. reddit.com reddit.com . students are encouraged to tap into that. in conclusion, the road from kgp leads anywhere you want. the institute and its culture equip you with a broad skillset – analytical thinking, perseverance (those endless assignments!), team working (through halls/fests), and a powerful alumni network. the most common advice from alumni regarding career choice is: follow your interest, don’t just herd, but also don’t fear taking a less-traveled path because

chunk 1282 content...
is: follow your interest, don’t just herd, but also don’t fear taking a less-traveled path because the initial brand and education will support you. some paths may have more certainty (like campus job) and some more risk (like startup or upsc), but kgpians have succeeded in all, so use the resources (counselors, seniors, placement office) to make an informed decision that aligns with your aspirations. whatever you choose, give it your best – and remember, it’s okay to change course later; career is a marathon, not a sprint. sources: reddit q&a about branch vs double major (career impact) reddit.com reddit.com ; alumni advice on cgpa vs skills for jobs reddit.com ; metakgp wiki on fests (leadership opportunities) wiki.metakgp.org ; kshitij info (tech dev) wiki.metakgp.org wiki.metakgp.org tech fests & clubs q: how can i get involved in spring fest or kshitij? a: both spring fest (the socio-cultural fest) and kshitij (techno-management fest) are student-organized extravaganzas, and

socio-cultural fest) and kshitij (techno-management fest) are student-organized extravaganzas, and joining their organizing teams is a fantastic way to gain experience. here’s how it generally works: for spring fest (sf): recruitment of the core organizing team usually happens in the semester preceding the fest, mostly among 2nd and 3rd year students. typically, the technology students’ gymkhana circulates an application or you’ll see posters/social media announcements calling for “coordinator applications”. there are usually various departments in the sf team – hospitality, events, publicity, marketing, operations, controls (event scheduling and results), design, etc. you apply by filling a form (sometimes with questions on your ideas for the fest, past experience in clubs, etc.). then there might be an interview by the current core team or gymkhana officials. they look for enthusiasm, relevant skills (e.g. if you’re good at design, you could be picked for design team; if you’ve been

chunk 1284 content...
relevant skills (e.g. if you’re good at design, you could be picked for design team; if you’ve been active in dramatics you may coordinate those events, etc.), and reliability. tip: in your first year, participate in events or volunteer during the fest – volunteers (like ushering guests, managing stages) get noticed and you can mention that experience. by second year, if you’ve been active in a cultural club or have volunteered, you stand a good chance to be selected as an sf coordinator. coordinators typically handle specific events or tasks, and a notch above are core team members (often final years or experienced third years) who oversee entire domains (like head of marketing, etc.). to become a core team member, one usually has served as a coord first or at least has substantial relevant experience. so it’s often a progression: volunteer → coordinator → core. that said, exceptions exist for highly proactive folks. during sf itself, even if not an organizer, you can join as an

exist for highly proactive folks. during sf itself, even if not an organizer, you can join as an event volunteer by contacting the coordinators of a particular event. for example, if you want to help in drama events, reach out to the dramatics coordinator; they often need extra hands during fest days. this is a lighter way to be involved if you missed formal selection. working for spring fest is quite rewarding – you get to interact with corporate sponsors, artists, other college participants, etc. plus, the sf team works hard and parties hard – there’s a strong camaraderie and an sf team t-shirt which is worn with pride. being an organizer also means you get certificates and possibly an official fest organiser tag on your resume (which companies do value as it shows teamwork and leadership). not to mention, you often get direct access to the concerts and meet celebrities (spring fest has star nights with famous musicians, as you know en.wikipedia.org ). for kshitij (ktj): similar

chunk 1286 content...
has star nights with famous musicians, as you know en.wikipedia.org ). for kshitij (ktj): similar structure but oriented to tech. recruitment happens via e-cell or gymkhana notices, usually in monsoon semester for the fest held in january/feb. teams include events (for each category of competitions – coding, robotics, etc.), workshops, finance, media/publicity, web operations (ktj is proud of its huge student-run website with millions of hits wiki.metakgp.org ), etc. if you have a coding background, you might fit the web ops or app development team. if you like networking with companies, sponsorship/finance team is good (they pitch to companies for funding and partnerships – great learning in corporate communication). as a first/second year, you could also become an event coordinator for a specific competition – meaning you handle registrations, problem statements, judging process etc. many event coords are chosen based on interest in that field (e.g. a robotics-enthusiast might

etc. many event coords are chosen based on interest in that field (e.g. a robotics-enthusiast might coordinate robowars). application for ktj team again is via forms and interviews. pro tip: mention any relevant experience – like if you were active in a tech club (say, robotics society), that’s directly useful for fest events. also, highlight soft skills – kshitij core wants people who are organized and can handle pressure, because hosting asia’s largest tech fest is no joke – participants from all over come, and events run simultaneously. if coding is your strength but you’re not interested in management, you can contribute as a developer – ktj often recruits students to build and maintain its online platform (the fest has complex online contests and registration portal). this might not involve event management, but it’s an important behind-the-scenes role. beyond official roles, both fests allow college participation: you can always form teams and compete in events. many students

chunk 1288 content...
fests allow college participation: you can always form teams and compete in events. many students balance both – organizing some events and participating in others that don’t conflict. though core organizers often sacrifice competing to avoid conflicts. clubs and societies also play a part – e.g., the dramatics and music teams of iit kgp typically curate some sf events or opening acts; tech clubs host competitions under kshitij banner. so being active in clubs often naturally leads to fest involvement. finally, after fest, outstanding organizers often get recognition. there’s usually a team photograph with the director etc., and a sense of accomplishment. being part of these fests not only is fun, it also teaches project management in a very hands-on way. as one alumnus said, leading spring fest marketing taught him more than any course about pitching and negotiating – which helped in his career. so, to summarize entry points: look out for gymkhana announcements (on notice boards,

his career. so, to summarize entry points: look out for gymkhana announcements (on notice boards, official fb/insta pages) around aug-sept for kshitij and around aug-nov for spring fest; network with current organizers (if you know a senior in sf team, express your interest – they can guide you); and engage with clubs relevant to fest events (e.g., join a cultural club for sf, tech club for ktj). q: how do club selections work? (e.g., coding club, dramatics, etc.) a: iit kharagpur has a rich variety of student clubs and societies under the gymkhana – technology clubs (programming, robotics, astronomy, finance, entrepreneurship, etc.), sports teams, and soc-cult clubs (drama, music, photography, literary, debate, etc.). most clubs hold inductions in the autumn semester (around aug/sept for freshers). the typical process: orientation: at start of session, there’s usually a freshers’ open iit where each society shows its stuff – e.g., dramatics gives a performance, technology clubs

chunk 1290 content...
open iit where each society shows its stuff – e.g., dramatics gives a performance, technology clubs display cool projects (robots, etc.). this is followed by orientation sessions where club seniors explain what the club does and encourage newbies to join. applications/tasks: many clubs then float a form or a task round. for example, the programming club might give a set of coding problems and shortlist those who solve a few. photography club may ask for sample photos you’ve clicked. literary society might ask for a short essay or conduct a small quiz. these tasks gauge interest and basic skill. don’t worry if you’re a complete beginner; clubs often value enthusiasm and willingness to learn as much as current skill. interviews/auditions: depending on club nature, next could be an interview or audition. for instance, drams (dramatics) will have auditions where you might be asked to do a mono-act or read a script to show voice modulation. music club (etms) auditions singers and

chunk 1291 content...
to do a mono-act or read a script to show voice modulation. music club (etms) auditions singers and instrumentalists. debate and quiz clubs might have an impromptu debate or quiz-off. tech clubs might do an interview to see how you think or how committed you are. they may also ask about any prior projects or just why you want to join. selections and mentorship: after that, they announce selected new members. if you don’t get in first year, you can often try again next year or join a related club. once in, clubs usually have an informal mentor-mentee setup – seniors train juniors for events (like inter-iit or competitions). for example, in the robotics club, seniors might guide freshers in building small bots, eventually picking them in the team for tech gc or external contests. clubs like academic societies (chemistry, electronics society, etc.) are often open-for-all or have minimal barrier – you show up and participate. but competitive ones like dramatics, or the official inter-iit

chunk 1292 content...
– you show up and participate. but competitive ones like dramatics, or the official inter-iit sports teams, naturally have limited slots. inter-iit sports selection is basically via performance in intra-hall events and trials coached by gymkhana coaches. note: there are also hall-level clubs/teams (like hall dramatics team, hall magazine team) – those are usually inclusive; if you show interest, halls involve you (because halls need participants for inter-hall competitions). many students first get experience via hall teams (less pressure, friendly environment) and then move to institute team. e.g., you act in your hall’s drama for soc-cult gc, do well, then join the institute dramatics society for spring fest etc. being in a club can be a significant time commitment, but extremely rewarding. it’s a chance to pursue passions beyond academics – whether it’s coding a new app, making short films, writing poems, or playing in a band. plus, clubs lead to representing iit kgp at

chunk 1293 content...
short films, writing poems, or playing in a band. plus, clubs lead to representing iit kgp at competitions: coding club members might go to acm icpc, drama club to inter-iit cultural meet, etc., which is a big honor. students often ask if clubs help in resume – yes, to an extent. they show extracurricular leadership. if you become say the secretary of a club in final year (most clubs have a student head/secretary), that’s a leadership role that stands out. but primarily, clubs are for personal growth and enjoyment, and they immensely enrich campus life. important: don’t join too many clubs just for the sake of it. it’s better to deeply engage in one or two that you really care about. seniors often caution freshmen who try to be in everything that it backfires academically and you can’t contribute meaningfully. instead, focus where your heart is. and if you change your mind, you can always shift – some students realize in second year that, say, they prefer entrepreneurship cell over

shift – some students realize in second year that, say, they prefer entrepreneurship cell over coding club and switch focus. club culture is quite welcoming in kgp. seniors in clubs build almost a family-like bond (the term “club junta” is used to refer to your fellow members). this network can also help later on (e.g., alumni from debating society might help a junior with upsc or law school advice, etc.). so to get into clubs: attend orientations, show genuine interest, complete whatever task diligently (even if it’s basic, seniors notice sincerity), and be confident in auditions. if rejected, don’t be disheartened – sometimes there are limited positions. you can still involve yourself informally or try next time. also, there are open opportunities outside formal clubs: e.g., if you love writing, you can write for the campus publications like awaaz or the scholar’s avenue newspaper without “joining” a club by just submitting articles. kgp has space for all levels of participation. q:

“joining” a club by just submitting articles. kgp has space for all levels of participation. q: what is illumination and rangoli exactly, and how do i participate? (this relates to tech fests & clubs in a way, as it’s hall-level but a big cultural highlight.) a: illumination (illu) is a unique iit kgp tradition where each hall of residence creates giant thematic designs on the night of diwali using thousands of oil lamps (diyas) mounted on wireframes metakgp.org . it’s a competition among halls and a breathtaking spectacle to witness (as mentioned earlier and shown in the image). rangoli is the accompanying floor art made with colored powders. together, illu and rangoli are hallmark cultural events for kgpians. participation in illu is by hall – so when you join a hall, as a junior you are strongly encouraged to take part. and you should – it’s an amazing experience of teamwork and creative engineering. preparation starts weeks before diwali. halls have an illu secy (general

and creative engineering. preparation starts weeks before diwali. halls have an illu secy (general secretary) who along with seniors decides on a concept/story for their illumination panels (often mythological, patriotic or socially relevant themes). they sketch designs and then hall students (you included) get to work: tying diyas (earthen lamps) on vertical wireframes called chatais, filling them with oil and wick. the work involves a lot of manual labor: bending wires, tying with koras (jute strings), placing diyas exactly according to the design outline, etc. it might sound arduous, and it is – students spend many late nights preparing (there’s even a term “illu night-outs”). but halls turn it into a fun, rallying activity – with music playing, everyone working together, seniors telling stories of past illu glory, and mass tempo shouts. the skills needed are not complex, so any fresher can help – whether by tying knots or lighting diyas with a torch on the final night. if you have

can help – whether by tying knots or lighting diyas with a torch on the final night. if you have an artistic knack, you can contribute in rangoli design and coloring as well. illu is more hall culture than club, but it’s a significant part of kgp life. it teaches coordination and fosters hall unity like nothing else – imagine 200 students moving in sync to light 20,000 diyas within minutes! as a participant, on illu night when the diyas all light up to reveal your hall’s design, an immense pride and joy washes over – many alumni say it’s one of their most cherished memories. since it’s hall-organized, to participate you just need to show up and volunteer in your hall’s illu prep. usually, seniors will make sure freshers do – sometimes nudging those who slack (in earlier times it was quasi-compulsory, now it’s more voluntary, but almost everyone joins in because it’s festive and fun in the end). there is an inter-hall judging by faculty and external judges, and they declare winners –

the end). there is an inter-hall judging by faculty and external judges, and they declare winners – winning illumination is a big honor for a hall. for rangoli, each hall selects a team of its more artistically talented folks to actually draw and fill the rangoli (often a giant one in front of the hall). if you have rangoli or sketching skills, let your cultural secy know – you might get to be on the rangoli team. otherwise, you can still help in filling colors, or logistics. no institute-level sign-up needed – it’s intrinsic to hall culture. so basically, once in first year, ask your hall seniors “illu ka kaam kab shuru hoga?” (when will illu work start). they’ll be delighted to see your enthusiasm and assign you tasks. it’s usually evenings post-classes that halls gather for illu work in the common room or terrace. illumination is a kind of unofficial “club” of its own – hall members become like a production unit. it also often involves making chatais that require some engineering

chunk 1299 content...
become like a production unit. it also often involves making chatais that require some engineering to stand upright, wind-proofing etc., so seniors from civil/mech help with that. it’s truly multidisciplinary. freshers might start by simply filling oil in diyas and end up learning to tie them by the end. concisely: to participate – be active in your hall around diwali time, volunteer for any work like diya filling/tying, and on illu night, definitely be present (wearing your hall tee, shouting your hall tempo high). it’s one of those “you have to be there to experience it” things – so don’t miss out by hiding in your room. many second/third years skip going home in diwali just not to miss illu, that’s how special it is. in summary, tech fests & clubs at iitkgp offer a wealth of opportunities to learn, lead, and enjoy beyond academics. whether by organizing mega-events like sf/ktj, or by joining clubs to hone talents, or by taking part in beloved traditions like illumination, you build

chunk 1300 content...
joining clubs to hone talents, or by taking part in beloved traditions like illumination, you build skills, friendships, and memories. the faqs in this realm often revolve around “how to get in, how to balance with studies, is it worth it?” – the answer to the last is a resounding yes from most alumni, as these activities often shape one’s personality and provide the soft skills (teamwork, communication, creativity) that complement academic learning. just be sure to manage time – an oft-quoted line is “studies are like your wife, clubs/fest are like your mistress – pay proper attention to both!” (tongue-in-cheek, but point taken). many seniors advise juniors: get involved in at least one or two extracurriculars – it will keep you sane and make your iit life holistic. iit kharagpur’s vibrant fests and clubs are integral to the “kgp experience”, so dive in and make the most of them. sources: reddit threads on spring fest volunteer experiences; metakgp wiki on illumination metakgp.org ;

left unattended during long vacations reddit.com ). the institute launched a public bicycle sharing system with app-based cycle rentals iitkgpfoundation.org – you can use those if you don’t have your own, but having your personal cycle is more convenient for daily use. also, maintain it – many a morning students find their cycle has a flat tyre; keeping it in shape avoids a long walk to class. weather and clothing: kharagpur weather is tropical. july-sept is monsoon – heavy rains, lots of puddles. keep an umbrella or raincoat in your bag always during this period. many students wear flip-flops during rains to class because shoes get soaked – but note some dep’t labs require closed shoes, so have a quick-dry pair. oct-nov is pleasant (high 20s °c) – the best time on campus. dec-jan brings surprisingly cold nights (as low as 8-10°c), with daytime around 20°c. there’s no heating, so you’ll need a couple of warm sweaters/hoodies and a blanket. many north indians underestimate bengal

need a couple of warm sweaters/hoodies and a blanket. many north indians underestimate bengal winter, but kgp’s humidity makes the cold bite – so pack some woolens. feb-mar is nice spring weather. apr-june gets very hot (35-40°c) – fans are a must, and a room cooler can be a savior in peak may (though hostels allow only certain wattage). a water bottle is essential year-round, and in summer stay hydrated; you can refill at department water coolers. another summer hack: afternoons can be oppressively hot; schedule studies or indoor activities then, and venture out in early morning or evening for sports. dealing with insects and animals: kgp is a lush campus, so you’ll encounter mosquitos (plenty!), occasional snakes (rarely, during monsoon in grassy areas), monkeys (certain halls near nehru market face monkey mischief), and stray dogs. for mosquitos, mosquito nets or repellents are highly advised – especially in old hostels or ground-floor rooms. many sleep under mosquito nets. the

advised – especially in old hostels or ground-floor rooms. many sleep under mosquito nets. the institute fogs mosquito repellent smoke sometimes, but not enough – dengue cases have happened, so be cautious. keep your windows meshed or shut at dusk. for monkeys – do not feed them; keep food locked because they sneak into rooms if they smell snacks. if monkeys frequent your hall, latch doors and windows when you leave. institute advice: “don’t encourage dogs or cats inside halls” hmc.iitkgp.ac.in – some students adopt strays, but note it’s officially discouraged due to hygiene. where to eat (beyond mess): we’ve touched on mess and canteens earlier. to recap and add: tech market is the go-to for variety – it has small eateries like vegies (pure veg, known for dosa and thali), billoo’s (north indian dhaba food), dreamland (dl) for indian-chinese, tikka for rolls and tandoori. there’s also a new food court near nalanda with various stalls. for late nights, halls’ night canteens operate

chunk 1305 content...
a new food court near nalanda with various stalls. for late nights, halls’ night canteens operate usually till 1-2 am (selling maggi, omelette, etc.). chedi’s outside main gate is open past midnight and famous for its chai, samosa, anda chop, etc., often bustling with students around 2 am. if you crave restaurant dining, gole bazaar (in town) has some good ones, and there’s zomato/swiggy delivery now available from select places in kharagpur town till 9-10 pm (some intrepid juniors even order from as far as medinipur via swiggy). within campus, if you want a break from mess, you can always grab a quick bite at nescafe stalls (there’s one near the library and one in nalanda) for coffee, sandwiches. on weekends, hogging at hoggie (the subway-like outlet) in tech market for a sub or vegetarian and non-veg thalis at thai pavilion (surprisingly a bengali food joint) are popular. also try the fruit juice center in tech market for fresh juice to beat the heat. favorite hangout spots:

chunk 1306 content...
try the fruit juice center in tech market for fresh juice to beat the heat. favorite hangout spots: students love spending time at rabindra sadan (the small lake behind the nehru museum – quiet and scenic), jagga (jnan ghosh stadium – jogging or informal sports), tech market circle in evenings for the lively atmosphere. main building lawns at night often have couples and friend groups chilling under the stars. if you want a little excursion, bc roy technology hospital roof is oddly a popular peaceful spot with panoramic campus view (allowed informally). and of course, hall common rooms themselves become social hubs – tt tables, carrom, tv during cricket matches. illu night and spring fest nights transform the campus with lights, food stalls, and crowds – those are essentially giant hangouts. lingo and culture: kgp has its own slang which we touched on – using terms like “lan bana” (let’s connect over lan for sharing movies), “gp” for good performance vs “lp” for low performance (play

chunk 1307 content...
connect over lan for sharing movies), “gp” for good performance vs “lp” for low performance (play on grade points), “fundae” for knowledge/tips metakgp.org , etc. there’s a quirky culture of nicknames – almost everyone gets some nickname in hall or by friends. don’t be surprised if you hardly hear real names; it’s part of bonding. memes and humor: follow pages like kgp confessions, kgp memes – they’re a source of campus jokes and help you stay in the loop of what everyone’s talking (be it a new relationship gossip or frustration about erp downtime). being part of these informal channels adds to the fun (though take confessions with a grain of salt – many are just jokes). academics vs fun balance: students frequently ask how to manage time with all the distractions. a hack many employ is timeboxing – e.g., study in library or your room after class till dinner, then post-dinner is free for clubs/socializing. or vice versa. also, because nights are active in kgp, some find it easier to

clubs/socializing. or vice versa. also, because nights are active in kgp, some find it easier to work late night when campus quiets down, and keep early evenings for extracurriculars. find your rhythm, but ensure you get adequate sleep somewhere – avoid the spiral of continuous night-outs (unless absolutely necessary) because it can affect health. safety: the campus is quite safe. you can roam at 3 am generally without fear of crime. just be cautious of stray dogs late at night in isolated areas – if you cycle past them too fast they might chase; usually going slow or dismounting calms them. for girls, campus is generally secure and patrolled; after midnight some halls require you sign out/in for late excursions. if you ever feel unsafe or see someone needing help (e.g., an accident), you can approach the campus security or call the control room. but incidents are rare – it’s a close-knit place. travel hacks: kharagpur station is nearby (~5 km). many students take local trains or

place. travel hacks: kharagpur station is nearby (~5 km). many students take local trains or buses to howrah/kolkata on weekends (approx 2 hrs) for a city break or catching a flight. the campus shuttle (techno bus) runs to the railway station at specific times (like during vacations exodus). book tickets early for end-sem breaks – trains get full. there’s also a decent cab service in kgp (uber/ola started, and local private cabs) if you’re going to kolkata airport directly. within town, e-rickshaws (totos) can take you from iit to gole bazaar or station cheaply. misc fun facts: the water tanks on top of some hostels are accessible (some students climb up for thrills or to paint batch graffiti – not endorsing, but it happens 😛). midnight endeavors: it’s common to spontaneously decide at 1 am, “chal na, 2.2 pe cycle lagate hain” (let’s go for a 2.2 km loop ride), or drive to prembazar outside campus for a cup of chai at highway dhabas. mt hall (girls) is humorously called “mythical

outside campus for a cup of chai at highway dhabas. mt hall (girls) is humorously called “mythical terror” and ig hall “integrated girls” as jokes. boys’ hall lbs is “launda badnaam sasura” punny expanded, etc. these are informal nicknames; each hall has some. ragging: officially zero tolerance and indeed campus has negligible overt ragging these days. what remains is a mild “interaction” culture: seniors may have group meets with freshers in halls to introduce and maybe tease in good spirit (the op period mentioned in lingo metakgp.org ). it’s generally friendly now, and any harassment can be reported and dealt with harshly by institute hmc.iitkgp.ac.in . so freshers needn’t worry; it’s not like the 90s stories. connectivity: internet is decent; wifi in academic area, lan in halls. mobile signals can be weak in some hall rooms; jio/airtel 4g works but often students rely on lan for heavy usage (and dc++ hub for internal sharing of… educational linux isos 😉). there’s also an htbt

who always takes load or a situation giving tension metakgp.org . eg: “don’t be a lodu, chill kar.” mt: multi-meaning. could be mother teresa hall. or “mass transfer” (a core cheme subject). or slang for an “empty”/useless thing (from hindi ‘maat tera’). people say “mt fundae” for knowledge that is useless. jhadoo: as mentioned, showing off or bragging, or doing something unrealistic. if someone says “i’ll finish the project in one night” and it sounds impossible, response: “jhadoo mat de” (don’t bullshit) 😅. phodu: means awesome/cracking (from “phod dala” – cracked it). “phodu banda” = extremely smart/talented guy. chaggi/satti/atthi/nehli/dassi: slang for cgpa ranges 6-7-8-9-10 respectively metakgp.org . so someone with 9+ cg is “nehli” – often used admiringly or mockingly: “nehli ho gaya tu!” if a friend aced an exam. gg: stands for general championship (but also gamers use it as “good game”). kgp context mostly the former – “our hall won sports gc, gg” (though new slang-savvy kids

game”). kgp context mostly the former – “our hall won sports gc, gg” (though new slang-savvy kids might use it in chats for ‘good going’ too). labus: short for lab exam or can mean being stuck in lab. “kal labus hai, yaar” means i have a lab exam tomorrow. proxy: not unique to kgp but important – giving proxy attendance for a friend. requires skill and guts; used sparingly now due to strict profs. c: saying just “c” means canteen (hall canteen) typically. eg. “meet at c at 11pm.” dkp: department change (depc) kabhi hota tha, ab nahi (branch change used to exist, now not). freshie / fachcha-fachchi: freshman male/female metakgp.org . often used in hall context – e.g. “freshie night” for juniors’ introduction night. ps: not postscript – here ps usually means productive sleep, a euphemism for dozing in class 😁 (“ps in hss lecture is common”). mt hall “oat”: mother teresa hall has an open air theater (oat) where girls hang out; guys joke like “mt oat is heaven” (because... girls). tibba:

theater (oat) where girls hang out; guys joke like “mt oat is heaven” (because... girls). tibba: the 2.2 track route mound near jnan ghosh – used like “meet at tibba for run”. lkp: stands for little kiddo program – not an official term, a sarcastic way seniors refer to some overly enthusiastic freshers. hall days & socials: each hall has a “hall day” (their annual celebration, inviting others for dinner, etc.) and “social” which is an intra-hall dance night usually with an invited partner hall of opposite gender. attending socials is a big excitement for freshers (first inter-hall mingling!). you’ll hear “rk–sn social is coming” etc. it’s basically a dj party. “kgp ka tempo high hai!” metakgp.org – the ultimate chant meaning “kgp’s spirit is high!” you will shout it at illumination, at wins, at random gatherings of pride. it embodies the kgp spirit. and many more little phrases you’ll pick up. kgp lingo evolves too – recent batches might use more internet slang, but the classic ones

policy also allows students to pursue research internships even if they have already secured an internship through the cdc, offering flexibility for academic and research pursuits.17the high conversion rate of internships into ppos indicates that these experiences are far more than just summer activities; they represent a critical gateway to securing full-time employment. a strong performance during the compulsory internship period can lead directly to a job offer, effectively streamlining the placement process for students and often providing a more desirable outcome earlier in their academic journey. this structure emphasizes that internships are integral to a student's career trajectory, serving as a primary platform for demonstrating skills, building professional networks, and ultimately securing a coveted full-time role.strategies for securing top placements (faang & beyond)securing placements at top-tier companies, including faang (facebook/meta, amazon, apple, netflix, google)

or via email can sometimes place an application at the top of the stack, particularly for smaller startups.24the strategic advantage gained by leveraging professional networks and securing referrals underscores that the job search is not solely about individual merit but also about visibility and access. referrals can help candidates bypass initial screening filters, providing a direct pathway to human review and significantly increasing the likelihood of an interview. this highlights the importance of proactive networking throughout a student's academic journey.off-campus placement strategieswhile on-campus placements through the cdc are a primary avenue, students also pursue off-campus opportunities. this approach is often described as a "numbers game," requiring a high volume of applications without compromising on quality.24finding job openingsvarious platforms are effective for identifying off-campus job openings:linkedin: consistently reported as a highly successful platform for

viva-voce and other factors that contribute to the final marks are to be considered by the teacher/co-ordination committee of a subject while converting marks into letter grades. (a) the grades f and ex are to be considered as bench mark grades. (b) the range of cut-off marks below which a student would be assigned an ‘*¥’ grade is 30-35 for the theory component and 35-40 for the laboratory component, the exact cut-off marks is to be decided by the teacher/co- ordination committee. (c) the exceptionally brilliant performance is to be assigned an ‘ex’ grade. even the best student of any class needs to be good enough to be awarded the ‘ex’ grade. (d)for subjects which have a laboratory component (p-component) along with the theory, to secure any grade higher than ¥’ a student has to achieve individually more than the cut-off marks in both the theory component and the laboratory component. separate marks, each out of 100 (hundred), in the theory component (l- & t- components) and the

of a relatively large class and/or classes rules and regulations updated -july 2018 page 27 where the performance level depicts more or less a normal distribution: (a) the average performance (around mean value of marks) is to be assigned ‘c’ grade. however, if by teacher’s/co-ordination committee’s perception the general level of the class is considered to be appreciably high, the average performance may be assigned ‘8b’ grade. (b) all other marks to grade conversion are to be done relatively with respect to the average performance in between (but excluding) the f and ex grades, which have already been assigned, by choosing appropriate boundary marks between grades. (c) normally, in a reasonably large class of students distribution of grades is expected to be as follows: table : 25.3 grade distribution <= 10% 10-20% 20-35 % 10-25% <=5% in the case where a student appears in the supplementary examination or attends summer quarter, the conversion from marks to grade would be done

surviving and thriving at iit kharagpur: the ultimate playbook 1. placements & career success – iit kgp’s placement stats vary wildly by branch. overall ug median is ₹20 lpa collegedunia.com , but core branches (cse/ece) see far higher medians (₹35–36 l), while many “old-generation” branches place ≤60–75% of students at lower packages【7†】. in practice, most companies set low cgpa cutoffs (~7.0–7.5 reddit.com ) and care more about interview performance. as one vit student put it, “official cgpa cutoff for most companies is low (~7 or 7.5)…super-dream non-core jobs don’t require 9+ cgpa” reddit.com . in fact, iit recruiters often filter early by pedigree/referral: as one senior bluntly notes, recruiters at top tech firms “don’t just look at your branch; they look at your pedigree. when they see ‘old iit’ on a resume, it skips half the filters” reddit.com . the alumni network is powerful – a well-placed kgp alumnus will seriously consider your referral request on linkedin reddit.com .

chunk 1645 content...
– a well-placed kgp alumnus will seriously consider your referral request on linkedin reddit.com . cgpa vs. skills: a very high cgpa (9+) can eliminate screening hurdles reddit.com , but it’s far from the only path to high ctc. many seniors emphasize hard skills and projects over grades once you clear eligibility filters. as one 2012 alumnus (chemical engg.) with 7.39 cgpa puts it: “cgpa is nice to have but more important is to develop … as a worthy and nice person… any cgpa would do if you are a hard worker and persistent. just don’t fail any courses… i graduated with 7.39, pretty below par. but [am] based in the us and happily married.” reddit.com . the key is demonstrable skill: strong coding contest records, open-source projects or research (especially in ai/ml/quant domains), and solid internships can outweigh a weak gpa. hidden factors: beyond grades, recruiters notice projects, contests, leadership roles and networks. active participation in technical clubs (robotics, coding,

chunk 1646 content...
contests, leadership roles and networks. active participation in technical clubs (robotics, coding, finance, consulting, etc.) or sports/societies puts you in contact with seniors and recruiters. join clubs and pors: juniors are advised to “join groups… [you] will have better exposure, better advice, better opportunities… contacts” reddit.com . pors (club president, hostel steward, etc.) signal leadership on your resume. alumni in industry routinely check linkedin: a kgp alumnus says referrals from kgp students “gets me to take that request seriously”. even coding contests and hackathons matter – good rankings often lead to direct invite mails from companies. breaking in at 20l+: bottom-line, low cg students can land ₹20l+ roles by maximizing other levers. tips: master dsa and system design on your own (many seniors “pick up advanced dsa… in my second year” to prepare for faang-style interviews reddit.com ). use the alumni network: ask seniors for referrals or mock-interviews. build a

reddit.com ). use the alumni network: ask seniors for referrals or mock-interviews. build a rich resume: even if you skip fancy pors, complete 1–2 solid projects (ai/ml, mobile/web apps, or research publications). keep your linkedin sharp and connect with at least 3 senior batches reddit.com . and network proactively at fests (kshitij, spring fest) and tech symposiums – recruiters often target these. how recruiters screen: most companies use applicant-tracking systems (ats) to filter resumes by keywords (so use a clean format and include relevant skills/projects). many set a cgpa eligibility (often ≥7.0–7.5 reddit.com ) or “no active backlog” rule, then shortlist by resumes and referrals. once selected, expect: (1) online assessment/coding test, (2) one or more technical interviews, (3) hr round. in early waves, cgpa can decide when you get interview slots (as one alumnus noted, he aced coding tests but didn’t get to second rounds until late in the season when higher-cg students were

chunk 1648 content...
coding tests but didn’t get to second rounds until late in the season when higher-cg students were placed reddit.com ). referrals help: iit alum referrals often bypass hr filtering. action checklist: build an ats-friendly resume (clear headings, bullet projects). continuously network (linkedin, alumni events, github, kaggle). hone coding skills early – cgpa won’t save you if you bomb the first technical screen. 2. study techniques of toppers: the difference between 9+ and average cgpa students is systematic work, not magic. topper habits include: attending every class (taking clear notes on key concepts), daily revision, solving extra problems (beyond assignments), and using past exams/old question papers. key tactics: active note-making: in lectures, listen and write smartly – note down definitions, formulae and any hints the professor gives (often exam questions are recycled). many top students rewrite or annotate their notes after class to clarify tough points. some use digital

chunk 1649 content...
top students rewrite or annotate their notes after class to clarify tough points. some use digital tools (one student raved about obsidian for organizing notes, calling it “the best thing out there… literally the only thing you will need” reddit.com ). whether on paper or app, link new info with old notes to build a concept web. regular revision: spread out study sessions over weeks (spaced repetition) rather than cramming. top students set weekly or monthly revision cycles: e.g. review monday lectures on wed/thu, do problem sets on sat, quick recall on sunday. before exams, form small study groups with peers to quiz each other (teaching concepts to others is a proven hack). as one senior says, even just knowing topic names and core formulae helps boost accuracy in exams reddit.com – but true mastery comes from repeated practice, not just last-minute reading. crack the lab & profs: treat labs as design/learning exercises – solve the pre-lab questions thoroughly so experiments are

chunk 1650 content...
treat labs as design/learning exercises – solve the pre-lab questions thoroughly so experiments are review. toppers treat tough professors as goldmines of insight: ask questions in class/office hours, and note profs’ “frequently repeated themes” (questions they emphasized, slides they emphasized). if you struggle with a subject, use iitkgp-specific hacks: watch nptel lectures (many kgp profs themselves coordinate nptel courses) or reference books, and borrow previous years’ printed notes from seniors (the ag hor, hyacinth, etc. materials are revered). the central library and departmental libraries are underutilized – top students go there to beat distractions. (as one alum advises freshmen: “score high gpa, go to library for studying” reddit.com .) depth vs. breadth: high-cg students often interleave academics with other activities seamlessly. in first/second year, they nail core courses (securing 9+ cgpa) while doing side projects or internships. by 3rd year, they leverage this

chunk 1651 content...
(securing 9+ cgpa) while doing side projects or internships. by 3rd year, they leverage this strong foundation to dive deeper: undergraduate research, open-source contributions, advanced certificates, etc., and hold pors or lead clubs. balance is key: work on one or two deep projects (e.g. publish a paper or build a robust app), while doing a few leadership roles just enough to show initiative. (a senior warns against having 15 very close friends and no network – instead have 2–3 close friends, 1000s of acquaintances, and use linkedin to “make contacts with 7 batches” of seniors/juniors reddit.com .) 3. time management & productivity: iit life is hectic; top students plan every hour. for example, one kgp student’s routine (typical 1st-year schedule) was: wake ~6:30 am, cycle to class by 8:00, classes till ~1:00 pm, lunch, then classes/labs 2–5 pm. after 5:00 pm all activities open: “we can chill, attend society meetings, study, work on projects” indianexpress.com . they enforce

chunk 1652 content...
“we can chill, attend society meetings, study, work on projects” indianexpress.com . they enforce structure: morning study or gym, afternoon classes, evening project/work time. some popular approaches: daily scheduling: use google calendar or todoist to block time – e.g. “7–9 am: gym; 9–12: classes; 3–4 pm: coding contest practice; 6–8 pm: assignment work.” top students stick to a sleep routine (~7–8 hrs). (one senior quips: your room should be for sleeping/resting only – evenings are for outdoors: library, sports, labs, or socializing reddit.com .) they often wake early (6–7 am) for focused study or exercise – beating campus busyness. taming distractions: iitians battle youtube, social media and gaming like everyone else. the most successful build habits: e.g. check instagram only after accomplishing a task. use apps like forest/flora (gamified pomodoro), stayfocusd or cold turkey (block distracting sites), and headspace/calm for quick meditation breaks. pair reward with work: study

distracting sites), and headspace/calm for quick meditation breaks. pair reward with work: study for 45 min then watch a fun video. contrarian tip: don’t feel guilty taking guilt-free breaks. even a 15-min walk or chat with a friend can recharge you – many top students report a short evening outing or power nap sharply improves focus. tools & apps: a few favorite tools among kgpians: notion/obsidian for unified note-taking and to-do lists, anki for spaced-repetition flashcards (very useful for tough formulas or definitions), google keep/evernote for quick to-do lists, and trello for project management. one student praised obsidian as “the only thing you will need” for organizing lectures and revision reddit.com . moreover, use the kgp discord or whatsapp groups to coordinate group studies and share notes/announcements. 4. relationships, breakups & mental health: iitkgp’s skewed gender ratio (roughly 4–5 males per female on campus) means dating can be competitive. however, the overall

(roughly 4–5 males per female on campus) means dating can be competitive. however, the overall scene is changing: recent classes have ~20–25% female students, and many students find partners in clubs, hostels or back home. common patterns: “juice parties” and college fests often help people socialize. advice from seniors: be active and approachable. make casual friends first; often romances start from friendship. as one alumni says, treat girls “like they’re normal people,” and focus on shared interests reddit.com . menorah or engineering fests are good settings to meet. dating vs. academics: it’s definitely possible to date while studying hard – many high-achievers manage both. prioritize time: schedule dates like any other commitment, and don’t go out in the middle of an exam crunch. importantly, don’t use relationships as a distraction: top students tend to date people who understand academic pressure and study schedules. breakups & rejection: heartbreaks hurt more under iit

higher studies (ms/phd) committees and some companies will see transcripts, so guard against future academic gaps. overall: past cgpa opened doors by getting you in iitkgp; beyond that, employers are far more interested in your projects, internships and interview performance. “is it okay to feel lost by 3rd year about my career?” – yes. many juniors and even seniors have no clear plan by 3rd year. use this time to explore: do mini-internships or projects in different domains, take electives in varied fields, attend career talks. talk to seniors in roles you’re curious about. try online challenges (kaggle, coding competitions, case contests) to sample areas. remember: specialization comes later. it’s perfectly normal to change interests – even freshers have core classes together and swap branches in moodle (§). just keep learning skills (programming, communication, etc.) that are universally valuable. “pors vs projects/skills – what should i focus on?” – both have value, but skills win

valuable. “pors vs projects/skills – what should i focus on?” – both have value, but skills win tech interviews. holding a leadership position (club chair, team lead) shows responsibility and communication – it's good on a resume. but pure gpa-boosting pors (like class rep) matter less unless you’re going for government or teaching careers. for tech jobs, impactful projects and skills carry more weight. balanced advice: try for at least one meaningful por (even organizing an event) to develop “soft” skills, but spend the bulk of your time on coding projects, research or internships that directly build your profile. employers notice a cool app or paper more than “won best speaker 2025.” “is gpa a scam or still king?” – it still matters, but isn’t everything. a very high gpa ensures access to all placement drives (especially core roles) – there are indeed some core/dream companies that unofficially expect 9+ reddit.com . conversely, a very low gpa can close doors (many companies won’t
